<h1><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9'></a>9</span>THE CORNER HOUSE GIRLS AMONG THE GYPSIES</h1>
<h2><a name='chI' id='chI'></a>CHAPTER I—THE FRETTED SILVER BRACELET</h2>
<p>
If Sammy Pinkney had not been determined to
play a “joey” and hooked back one of the garage
doors so as to enter astride a broomstick with
a dash and the usual clown announcement, “Here
we are again!” all would not have happened that
did happen to the Corner House girls—at least,
not in just the way the events really occurred.
</p>
<p>
Even Dot, who was inclined to be forgiving of
most of Sammy’s sins both of omission and commission,
admitted that to be true. Tess, the next
oldest Corner House girl (nobody ever dignified
her with the name of “Theresa,” unless it were
Aunt Sarah Maltby) was inclined to reflect the
opinion regarding most boys held by their oldest
sister, Ruth. Tess’s frank statement to this day
is that it was entirely Sammy’s fault that they
were mixed up with the Gypsies at all.
</p>
<p>
But—
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10'></a>10</span>
</p>
<p>
“Well, if I’m going to be in your old circus,”
Sammy announced doggedly, “I’m going to be a
joey—or <em>nothin’</em>.”
</p>
<p>
“You know very well, Sammy, that you can’t
be that,” said Tess reprovingly.
</p>
<p>
“Huh? Why can’t I? I bet I’d make just as
good a clown as Mr. Sully Sorber, who is Neale’s
half-uncle, or Mr. Asa Scruggs, who is Barnabetta’s
father.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t mean you can’t be a clown,” interrupted
Tess. “I mean you can’t be just <em>nothing</em>.
You occupy space, so you must be something. Our
teacher says so.”
</p>
<p>
“Shucks!” ejaculated Sammy Pinkney.
“Don’t I know that? And I wish you wouldn’t
talk about school. Why! we’re only in the middle
of our vacation, I should hope.”
</p>
<p>
“It seems such a long time since we went to
school,” murmured Dot, who was sitting by, nursing
the Alice-doll in her arms and waiting her
turn to be called into the circus ring, which was
the cleared space in the middle of the cement floor.
</p>
<p>
“That’s because all you folks went off cruising
on that houseboat and never took me with you,”
grumbled Sammy, who still held a deep-seated
grouch because of the matter mentioned. “But
’tain’t been long since school closed—and it isn’t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11'></a>11</span>
going to be long before the old thing opens
again.”
</p>
<p>
“Why, Sammy!” admonished Tess.
</p>
<p>
“I just <em>hate</em> school, so I do!” vigorously announced
the boy. “I’d rather be a tramp—or a
Gypsy. Yes, I would.”
</p>
<p>
“Or a pirate, Sammy?” suggested Dot reflectively.
“You know, me and you didn’t have a
very nice time when we went off to be pirates.
’Member?”
</p>
<p>
“Huh!” grumbled Sammy, “that was because
you was along. Girls can’t be pirates worth
shucks. And anyway,” he concluded, “I’m going
to be the joey in this show, or I won’t play.”
</p>
<p>
“It will be supper time and the others will be
back with the car, so none of us can play if we
don’t start in pretty soon,” Tess observed. “Dot
and I want to practice our gym work that Neale
O’Neil has been teaching us. But you can clown
it all you want to, Sammy.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, that lets me begin the show anyway,”
Sammy stated with satisfaction.
</p>
<p>
He always did want to lead. And now he immediately
ran to hook back the door and prepared
to make his entrance into the ring in true clowning
style, as he had seen Sully Sorber do in Twomley
&amp; Sorber’s Herculean Circus and Menagerie.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12'></a>12</span>
</p>
<p>
The Kenway garage opened upon Willow Street
and along that pleasantly shaded and quiet thoroughfare
just at this time came three rather odd
looking people. Two were women carrying
brightly stained baskets of divers shapes, and one
of these women—usually the younger one—went
into the yard of each house and knocked at the
side or back door, offering the baskets for sale.
</p>
<p>
The younger one was black-eyed and rather
pretty. She was neatly dressed in very bright
colors and wore a deal of gaudy jewelry. The
older woman was not so attractive—or so clean.
</p>
<p>
Loitering on the other side of the street, and
keeping some distance behind the Gypsy women,
slouched a tall, roughly clad fellow who was evidently
their escort. The women came to the Kenway
garage some time after Sammy Pinkney had
made his famous “entrance” and Dot had abandoned
the Alice-doll while she did several handsprings
on the mattress that Tess had laid down.
Dot did these very well indeed. Neale O’Neil,
who had been trained in the circus, had given
both the smaller Corner House girls the benefit
of his advice and training. They loved athletic
exercises. Mrs. McCall, the Corner House housekeeper,
declared Tess and Dot were as active as
grasshoppers.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13'></a>13</span>
</p>
<p>
The two dark-faced women, as they peered in
at the open doorway of the garage, seemed to
think Dot’s handsprings were marvelously well
done, too; they whispered together excitedly and
then the older one slyly beckoned the big Gypsy
man across the street to approach.
</p>
<p>
When he arrived to look over the women’s
heads it was Tess who was actively engaged on
the garage floor. She was as supple as an eel.
Of course, Tess Kenway would not like to be compared
to an eel; but she was proud of her ability
to “wriggle into a bow knot and out again”—as
Sammy vociferously announced.
</p>
<p>
“Say, Tess! that’s a peach of a trick,” declared
the boy with enthusiasm. “Say! Lemme—Huh!
What do <em>you</em> want?” For suddenly he saw the
two Gypsy women at the door of the garage. The
man was now out of sight.
</p>
<p>
“Ah-h!” whined the old woman cunningly,
“will not the young master and the pretty little
ladies buy a nice basket of the poor Gypsy? Good
fortune goes with it.”
</p>
<p>
“Gee! who wants to buy a basket?” scoffed
Sammy. “You only have to carry things in it.”
The bane of Sammy Pinkney’s existence was the
running of errands.
</p>
<p>
“But they <em>are</em> pretty,” murmured Tess.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14'></a>14</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh—oo! See that nice green and yellow one
with the cover,” gasped Dot. “Do you suppose
we’ve got money enough to buy that one, Tess?
How nice it would be to carry the children’s
clothes in when we go on picnics.”
</p>
<p>
By “children” Dot meant their dolls, of which,
the two smaller Corner House girls possessed a
very large number. Several of these children,
besides the Alice-doll, were grouped upon a bench
in the corner of the garage as a part of the circus
audience. The remainder of the spectators were
Sandyface and her family. Sandyface was now a
great, <em>great</em> grandmother cat, and more of her
progeny than one would care to catalog tranquilly
viewed the little girls’ circus or rolled in kittenish
frolic on the floor.
</p>
<p>
It sometimes did seem as though the old Corner
House demesne was quite given up to feline inhabitants.
And the recurrent appearance of new
litters of kittens belonging to Sandyface herself,
her daughters and granddaughters, had ceased to
make even a ripple in the pool of Corner House
existence.
</p>
<p>
This explanation regarding the dolls and cats
is really aside from our narrative. Tess and Dot
both viewed with eager eyes the particular covered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15'></a>15</span>
basket held out enticingly by the old Gypsy
woman.
</p>
<p>
Of course the little girls had no pockets in their
gymnasium suits. But in a pocket of her raincoat
which Tess had worn down to the garage over
her blouse and bloomers, she found a dime and
two pennies—“just enough for two ice-cream
cones,” Sammy Pinkey observed.
</p>
<p>
“Oh! And my Alice-doll has eight cents in her
cunning little beaded bag,” cried Dot, with sudden
animation.
</p>
<p>
She produced the coins. But there was only
twenty cents in all!
</p>
<p>
“I—I—What do you ask for that basket,
please?” Tess questioned cautiously.
</p>
<p>
“Won’t the pretty little ladies give the poor old
Gypsy woman half a dollar for the basket?”
</p>
<p>
The little girls lost hope. They were not allowed
to break into their banks for any purpose
without asking Ruth’s permission, and their
monthly stipend of pocket money was very low.
</p>
<p>
“It is a very nice basket, little ladies,” said
the younger Gypsy woman—she who was so gayly
dressed and gaudily bejeweled.
</p>
<p>
“I know,” Tess admitted wistfully. “But if
we haven’t so much money, how can we buy it?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16'></a>16</span>
</p>
<p>
“Say!” interrupted the amateur joey, hands
in pockets and viewing the controversy quite as an
outsider. “Say, Tess! if you and Dot really want
that old basket, I’ve got two-bits I’ll lend you.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Sammy!” gasped Dot. “A whole quarter?”
</p>
<p>
“Have you got it here with you?” Tess asked.
</p>
<p>
“Yep,” announced the boy.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t think Ruth would mind our borrowing
twenty-five cents of you, Sammy,” said Tess,
slowly.
</p>
<p>
“Of course not,” urged Dot. “Why, Sammy is
just like one of the family.”
</p>
<p>
“Only when you girls go off cruising, I ain’t,”
observed Sammy, his face clouding with remembrance.
“<em>Then</em> I ain’t even a step-child.”
</p>
<p>
But he produced the quarter and offered it to
Tess. She counted it with the money already in
her hand.
</p>
<p>
“But—but that makes only forty-five cents,”
she said.
</p>
<p>
The two Gypsy women spoke hissingly to each
other in a tongue that the children did not, of
course, understand. Then the older woman thrust
the basket out again.
</p>
<p>
“Take!” she said. “Take for forty-fi’ cents,
eh? The little ladies can have.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17'></a>17</span>
</p>
<p>
“Go ahead,” Sammy said as Tess hesitated.
“That’s all the old basket is worth. I can get one
bigger than that at the chain store for seven
cents.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Sammy, it isn’t as bee-<em>you</em>-tiful as this!”
gasped Dot.
</p>
<p>
“Well, it’s a basket just the same.”
</p>
<p>
Tess put the silver and pennies in the old woman’s
clawlike hand and the longed-for basket came
into her possession.
</p>
<p>
“It is a good-fortune basket, pretty little ladies,”
repeated the old Gypsy, grinning at them
toothlessly. “You are honest little ladies, I can
see. You would never cheat the old Gypsy, would
you? This is all the money you have to pay for
the beautiful basket? Forty-fi’ cents?”
</p>
<p>
“Aw, say!” grumbled Sammy, “a bargain is a
bargain, ain’t it? And forty-five cents is a good
deal of money.”
</p>
<p>
“If—if you think we ought to pay more—”
</p>
<p>
Tess held the basket out hesitatingly. Dot
fairly squealed:
</p>
<p>
“Don’t be a ninny, Tessie Kenway! It’s ours
now.”
</p>
<p>
“The basket is yours, little ladies,” croaked the
crone as the younger woman pulled sharply at her
shawl. “But good fortune goes with it only if
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18'></a>18</span>
you are honest with the poor old Gypsy. Good-bye.”
</p>
<p>
The two strange women hurried away. Sammy
lounged to the door, hands in pockets, to look
after them. He caught a momentary glimpse of
the tall Gypsy man disappearing around a corner.
The two women quickly followed him.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, what a lovely basket!” Dot was saying.
</p>
<p>
“I—I hope Ruth won’t scold because we borrowed
that quarter of Sammy,” murmured Tess.
</p>
<p>
“Shucks!” exclaimed their boy friend. “Don’t
tell her. You can pay me when you get some more
money.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, no!” Tess said. “I would not hide anything
from Ruth.”
</p>
<p>
“You couldn’t, anyway,” said the practical
Dot. “She will want to know where we got the
money to pay for the basket. Oh, <em>do</em> open it,
Tess. Isn’t it lovely?”
</p>
<p>
The cover worked on a very ingeniously contrived
hinge. Had the children known much about
such things they must have seen that the basket
was worth much more than the price they had
paid for it—much more indeed than the price the
Gypsies had first asked.
</p>
<p>
Tess lifted the cover. Dot crowded nearer to
look in. The shadows of the little girls’ heads at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19'></a>19</span>
first hid the bottom of the basket. Then both saw
something gleaming dully there. Tess and Dot
cried out in unison; but it was the latter’s brown
hand that darted into the basket and brought
forth the bracelet.
</p>
<p>
“A silver bracelet!” Tess gasped.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, look at it!” cried Dot. “Did you <em>ever</em>?
Do you s’pose it’s real silver, Tess?”
</p>
<p>
“Of course it is,” replied her sister, taking the
circlet in her own hand. “How pretty! It’s all
engraved with fret-work—”
</p>
<p>
“Hey!” ejaculated Sammy coming closer.
“What’s that?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Sammy! A silver bracelet—all fretted,
too,” exclaimed the highly excited Dot.
</p>
<p>
“Huh! What’s that? ‘Fretted’? When my
mother’s fretted she’s—Say! how can a silver
bracelet be cross, I want to know?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Sammy,” Tess suddenly ejaculated,
“these Gypsy women will be cross enough when
they miss this bracelet!”
</p>
<p>
“Oh! Oh!” wailed Dot. “Maybe they’ll come
back and want to take it and the pretty basket,
Tess. Let’s run and hide ’em!”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20'></a>20</span><a name='chII' id='chII'></a>CHAPTER II—A PROFOUND MYSTERY</h2>
<p>
Tess Kenway was positively shocked by her
sister Dot’s suggestion. To think of trying to
keep the silver bracelet which they knew must belong
to the Gypsy woman who had sold them the
green and yellow basket, was quite a horrifying
thought to Tess.
</p>
<p>
“How <em>can</em> you say such a thing, Dottie Kenway?”
she demanded sternly. “Of course we
cannot keep the bracelet. And that old Gypsy
lady said we were honest, too. She could <em>see</em> we
were. And, then, what would Ruthie say?”
</p>
<p>
Their older sister’s opinion was always the
standard for the other Corner House girls. And
that might well be, for Ruth Kenway had been
mentor and guide to her sisters ever since Dot, at
least, could remember. Their mother had died
so long ago that Tess but faintly remembered
her.
</p>
<p>
The Kenways had lived in a very moderately
priced tenement in Bloomsburg when Mr. Howbridge
(now their guardian) had searched for and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21'></a>21</span>
found them, bringing them with Aunt Sarah
Maltby to the old Corner House in Milton. In
the first volume of this series, “The Corner House
Girls,” these matters are fully explained.
</p>
<p>
The six succeeding volumes relate in detail the
adventures of the four sisters and their friends—and
some most remarkable adventures have they
had at school, under canvas, at the seashore, as
important characters in a school play, solving the
mystery of a long-lost fortune, on an automobile
tour through the country, and playing a winning
part in the fortunes of Luke and Cecile Shepard
in the volume called “The Corner House Girls
Growing Up.”
</p>
<p>
In “The Corner House Girls Snowbound,” the
eighth book of the series, the Kenways and a number
of their young friends went into the North
Woods with their guardian to spend the Christmas
Holidays. Eventually they rescued the twin
Birdsall children, who likewise had come under
the care of the elderly lawyer who had so long
been the Kenway sisters’ good friend.
</p>
<p>
During the early weeks of the summer, just
previous to the opening of our present story, the
Corner House girls had enjoyed a delightful trip
on a houseboat in the neighboring waters. The
events of this trip are related in “The Corner
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22'></a>22</span>
House Girls on a Houseboat.” During this outing
there was more than one exciting incident. But
the most exciting of all was the unexpected appearance
of Neale O’Neil’s father, long believed
lost in Alaska.
</p>
<p>
Mr. O’Neil’s return to the States could only be
for a brief period, for his mining interests called
him back to Nome. His son, however, no longer
mourned him as lost, and naturally (though this
desire he kept secret from Agnes) the boy hoped,
when his school days were over, to join his father
in that far Northland.
</p>
<p>
There was really no thought in the mind of the
littlest Corner House girl to take that which did
not belong to her. Most children believe implicitly
in “findings-keepings,” and it seemed to Dot
Kenway that as they had bought the green and
yellow basket in good faith of the two Gypsy
women, everything it contained should belong to
them.
</p>
<p>
This, too, was Sammy Pinkney’s idea of the
matter. Sammy considered himself very worldly
wise.
</p>
<p>
“Say! what’s the matter with you, Tess Kenway?
Of course that bracelet is yours—if you
want it. Who’s going to stop you from keeping it,
I want to know?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23'></a>23</span>
</p>
<p>
“But—but it must belong to one of those Gypsy
ladies,” gasped Tess. “The old lady asked us if
we were honest. Of course we are!”
</p>
<p>
“Pshaw! If they miss it, they’ll be back after
that silver thing fast enough.”
</p>
<p>
“But, Sammy, suppose they don’t know the
bracelet fell into this basket?”
</p>
<p>
“Then you and Dot are that much in,” was the
prompt rejoinder of their boy friend. “You
bought the basket and all that was in it. They
couldn’t claim the <em>air</em> in that basket, could they?
Well, then! how could they lay claim to anything
else in the basket?”
</p>
<p>
Such logic seemed unanswerable to Dot’s mind.
But Tess shook a doubtful head. She had a feeling
that they ought to run after the Gypsies to
return to them at once the bracelet. Only, neither
she nor Dot was dressed properly to run through
Milton’s best residential streets after the Romany
people. As for Sammy—
</p>
<p>
Happily, so Tess thought, she did not have to
decide the matter. Musically an automobile horn
sounded its warning and the children ran out to
welcome the two older Corner House girls and
Neale O’Neil, who acted as their chauffeur on this
particular trip.
</p>
<p>
They had been far out into the country for eggs
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24'></a>24</span>
and fresh vegetables, to the farm, in fact, of Mr.
Bob Buckham, the strawberry king and the Corner
House girls’ very good friend. In these times of
very high prices for food, Ruth Kenway considered
it her duty to save money if she could by purchasing
at first cost for the household’s needs.
</p>
<p>
“Otherwise,” this very capable young housewife
asked, “how shall we excuse the keeping of
an automobile when the up-keep and everything
is so high?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, <em>do</em>,” begged Agnes, the flyaway sister,
“<em>do</em> let us have something impractical, Ruth. I
just hate the man who wrote the first treatise on
political economy.”
</p>
<p>
“I fancy it is ‘household economy’ you mean,
Aggie,” returned her sister, smiling. “And I
warrant the author of the first treatise on that
theme was a woman.”
</p>
<p>
“Mrs. Eva Adam, I bet!” chuckled Neale
O’Neil, hearing this controversy from the driver’s
seat. “It has always been in my mind that the
First Lady of the Garden of Eden was tempted to
swipe those apples more because the price of other
fruit was so high than for any other reason.”
</p>
<p>
“Then Adam was stingy with the household
money,” declared Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“I really wish you would not use such words as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25'></a>25</span>
‘swipe’ before the children, Neale,” sighed Ruth
who, although she was no purist, did not wish the
little folk to pick up (as they so easily did) slang
phrases.
</p>
<p>
She stepped out of the car when Neale had
halted it within the garage and Agnes handed her
the egg basket. Tess and Dot immediately began
dancing about their elder sister, both shouting at
once, the smallest girl with the green and yellow
basket and Tess with the silver bracelet in her
hand.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Ruthie, what do you think?”
</p>
<p>
“See how pretty it is! And they never missed
it.”
</p>
<p>
“<em>Can’t</em> we keep it, Ruthie?” This from Dot.
“We paid those Gypsy ladies for the basket and
all that was in it. Sammy says so.”
</p>
<p>
“Then it must be true of course,” scoffed Agnes.
“What is it?”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I guess I know some things,” observed
Sammy, bridling. “If you buy a walnut you buy
the kernel as well as the shell, don’t you? And
that bracelet was inside that covered basket, like
the kernel in a nut.”
</p>
<p>
“Listen!” exclaimed Neale likewise getting out
of the car. “Sammy’s a very Solomon for judgment.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26'></a>26</span>
</p>
<p>
“Now don’t you call me that, Neale O’Neil!”
ejaculated Sammy angrily. “I ain’t a pig.”
</p>
<p>
“Wha—what! Who called you a pig, Sammy?”
</p>
<p>
“Well, that’s what Mr. Con Murphy calls <em>his</em>
pig—‘Solomon.’ You needn’t call me by any pig-name,
so there!”
</p>
<p>
“I stand reproved,” rejoined Neale with mock
seriousness. “But, see here: What’s all this
about the basket and the bracelet—a two-fold
mystery?”
</p>
<p>
“It sounds like a thriller in six reels,” cried
Agnes, jumping out of the car herself to get a
closer view of the bracelet and the basket. “My!
Where did you get that gorgeous bracelet, children?”
</p>
<p>
The beauty of the family, who loved “gew-gaws”
of all kinds, seized the silver circlet and
tried it upon her own plump arm. Ruth urged
Tess to explain and had to place a gentle palm
upon Dot’s lips to keep them quiet so that she
might get the straight of the story from the more
sedate Tess.
</p>
<p>
“And so, that’s how it was,” concluded Tess.
“We bought the basket after borrowing Sammy’s
twenty-five cent piece, and of course the basket
belongs to us, doesn’t it, Ruthie?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27'></a>27</span>
</p>
<p>
“Most certainly, my dear,” agreed the elder
sister.
</p>
<p>
“And inside was that beautiful fretted silver
bracelet. And that—”
</p>
<p>
“Just as certainly belongs to the Gypsies,” finished
Ruth. “At least, it does not belong to you
and Dot.”
</p>
<p>
“Aw shu-u-cks!” drawled Sammy in dissent.
</p>
<p>
Even Agnes cast a wistful glance at the older
girl. Ruth was always so uncompromising in her
decisions. There was never any middle ground
in her view. Either a thing was right, or it was
wrong, and that was all there was to it!
</p>
<p>
“Well,” sighed Tess, “that Gypsy lady <em>said</em> she
knew we were honest.”
</p>
<p>
“I think,” Ruth observed thoughtfully, “that
Neale had better run the car out again and look
about town for those Gypsy women. They can’t
have got far away.”
</p>
<p>
“Say, Ruth! it’s most supper time,” objected
Neale. “Have a heart!”
</p>
<p>
“Anyway, I wouldn’t trouble myself about a
crowd of Gypsies,” said Agnes. “They may have
stolen the bracelet.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh!” gasped Tess and Dot in unison.
</p>
<p>
“You know what June Wildwood told us about
them. And she lived with Gypsies for months.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28'></a>28</span>
</p>
<p>
“Gypsies are not all alike,” the elder sister said
confidently in answer to this last remark by Agnes.
“Remember Mira and King David Stanley,
and how nice they were to Tess and Dottie?” she
asked, speaking of an incident related in “The
Corner House Girls on a Tour.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t care!” exclaimed Agnes, pouting, and
still viewing the bracelet on her arm with admiration.
“I wouldn’t run <em>my</em> legs off chasing a band
of Gypsies.”
</p>
<p>
They were all, however, bound to be influenced
by Ruth’s decision.
</p>
<p>
“Well, I’ll hunt around after supper,” Neale
said. “I’ll take Sammy with me. You’ll know
those women if you see them again, won’t you,
kid?”
</p>
<p>
“Sure,” agreed Sammy, forgiving Neale for
calling him “kid” with the prospect of an automobile
ride in the offing.
</p>
<p>
“But—but,” breathed Tess in Ruth’s ear, “if
those Gypsy ladies don’t take back the bracelet,
it belongs to Dot and me, doesn’t it, Sister?”
</p>
<p>
“Of course. Agnes! do give it back, now. I
expect it will cause trouble enough if those women
are not found. A bone of contention! Both these
children will want to wear the bracelet at the same
time. Don’t <em>you</em> add to the difficulty, Agnes.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29'></a>29</span>
</p>
<p>
“Why,” drawled Agnes, slowly removing the
curiously engraved silver ornament from her arm,
“of course they will return for it. Or Neale will
find them.”
</p>
<p>
This statement, however, was not borne out by
the facts. Neale and Sammy drove all about town
that evening without seeing the Gypsy women.
The next day the smaller Corner House girls were
taken into the suburbs all around Milton; but nowhere
did they find trace of the Gypsies or of any
encampment of those strange, nomadic people in
the vicinity.
</p>
<p>
The finding of the bracelet in the basket remained
a mystery that the Corner House girls
could not soon forget.
</p>
<p>
“It does seem,” said Tess, “as though those
Gypsy ladies couldn’t have meant to give us the
bracelet, Dot. The old one said so much about
our being honest. She didn’t expect us to <em>steal</em>
it.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, no!” agreed Dot. “But Neale O’Neil says
maybe the Gypsy ladies stole it, and were afraid
to keep it. So they gave it to us.”
</p>
<p>
“M-mm,” considered Tess. “But that doesn’t
explain it at all. Even if they wanted to get rid
of the bracelet, they need not have given it to us
in such a lovely basket. Ruth says the basket is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30'></a>30</span>
worth a whole lot more than the forty-five cents
we paid for it.”
</p>
<p>
“It <em>is</em> awful pretty,” sighed Dot in agreement.
</p>
<p>
“Some day they will surely come back for the
bracelet.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I hope not!” murmured the littlest Corner
House girl. “It makes such a be-<em>you</em>-tiful belt
for my Alice-doll, when it’s my turn to wear it.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31'></a>31</span><a name='chIII' id='chIII'></a>CHAPTER III—SAMMY PINKNEY IN TROUBLE</h2>
<p>
Uncle Rufus, who was general factotum about
the old Corner House and even acted as butler on
“date and state occasions,” was a very brown
man with a shiny bald crown around three-quarters
of the circumference of which was a hedge of
white wool. Aided by Neale O’Neil (who still insisted
on earning a part of his own support in
spite of the fact that Mr. Jim O’Neil, his father,
expected in time to be an Alaskan millionaire
gold-miner), Uncle Rufus did all of the chores
about the place. And those chores were multitudinous.
</p>
<p>
Besides the lawns and the flower gardens to
care for, there was a good-sized vegetable garden
to weed and to hoe. Uncle Rufus suffered from
what he called a “misery” in his back that made
it difficult for him to stoop to weed the small
plants in the garden.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know, Missy Ruth,” complained the old
darkey to the eldest Corner House girl, “how I’s
goin’ to get that bed of winter beets weeded—I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32'></a>32</span>
dunno, noways. My misery suah won’t let me
stoop down to them rows, and there’s a big patch
of ’em.”
</p>
<p>
“Do they need weeding right now, Uncle
Rufus?”
</p>
<p>
“Suah do, Missy. Dey is sufferin’ fo’ hit. I’d
send wo’d for some o’ mah daughter Pechunia’s
young ‘uns to come over yere, but I knows dat all
o’ them that’s big enough to work is reg’larly
employed by de farmers out dat a-way. Picking
crops for de canneries is now at de top-notch,
Missy; and even Burnejones Whistler and Louise-Annette
is big enough to pick beans.”
</p>
<p>
“Goodness me!” exclaimed Agnes, who overheard
the old man’s complaint. “There ought to
be kids enough around these corners to hire, without
sending to foreign lands for any. They are
always under foot if you <em>don’t</em> want them.”
</p>
<p>
“Ain’t it de truf?” chuckled the old man.
“Usual’ I can’t look over de hedge without
spyin’ dat Sammy Pinkney and a dozen of his
crew. They’s jest as plenty as bugs under a chip.
But now—”
</p>
<p>
“Well, why not get Sammy?” interrupted
Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“He ought to be of some use, that is sure,”
added Agnes.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33'></a>33</span>
</p>
<p>
“Can yo’ put yo’ hand on dat boy?” demanded
Uncle Rufus. “‘Nless he’s in mischief I don’t
know where to look for him.”
</p>
<p>
“I can find him all right,” Agnes declared.
“But I cannot guarantee that he will take the
job.”
</p>
<p>
“Offer him fifty cents to weed those beet rows,”
Ruth said briskly. “The bed I see is just a mat of
weeds.” They had walked down to the garden
while the discussion was going on. “If Sammy
will do it I’ll be glad to pay the half dollar.”
</p>
<p>
She bustled away about some other domestic
matter; for despite the fact that Mrs. McCall bore
the greater burden of housekeeping affairs, Ruth
Kenway did not shirk certain responsibilities that
fell to her lot both outside and inside the Corner
House.
</p>
<p>
After all was said and done, Sammy Pinkney
looked upon Agnes as his friend. She was more
lenient with him than even Dot was. Ruth and
Tess looked upon most boys as merely “necessary
evils.” But Agnes had always liked to play with
boys and was willing to overlook their shortcomings.
</p>
<p>
“I got a lot to do,” ventured Sammy, shying as
usual at the idea of work. “But if you really
want me to, Aggie—”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34'></a>34</span>
</p>
<p>
“And if you want to make a whole half dollar,”
suggested Agnes, not much impressed by the idea
that Sammy would weed beets as a favor.
</p>
<p>
“All right,” agreed the boy, and shooing Buster,
his bulldog, out of the Corner House premises,
for Buster and Billy Bumps, the goat, were sworn
enemies, Sammy proceeded to the vegetable
garden.
</p>
<p>
Now, both Uncle Rufus and Agnes particularly
showed Sammy which were the infant beets and
which the weeds. It is a fact, however, that there
are few garden plants grown for human consumption
that do not have their counterpart among the
noxious weeds.
</p>
<p>
The young beets, growing in scattered clumps in
the row (for each seed-burr contains a number of
seeds), looked much like a certain weed of the
lambs’-quarters variety; and this reddish-green
weed pretty well covered the beet bed.
</p>
<p>
Tess and Dot had gone to a girls’ party at Mrs.
Adams’, just along on Willow Street, that afternoon,
so they did not appear to disturb Sammy
at his task. In fact, the boy had it all his own way.
Neither Uncle Rufus nor any other older person
came near him, and he certainly made a thorough
job of that beet bed.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. McCall “set great store,” as she said, by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35'></a>35</span>
beets—both pickled and fresh—for winter consumption.
When Neale O’Neil chanced to go into
the garden toward supper time to see what
Sammy was doing there, it was too late to save
much of the crop.
</p>
<p>
“Well, of all the dunces!” ejaculated Neale,
almost immediately seeing what Sammy had been
about. “Say! you didn’t do that on purpose, did
you? Or don’t you know any better?”
</p>
<p>
“Know any better’n <em>what</em>?” demanded the
bone-weary Sammy, in no mood to endure scolding
in any case. “Ain’t I done it all right? I bet
you can’t find a weed in that whole bed, so now.”
</p>
<p>
“Great grief, kid!” gasped the older boy, seeing
that Sammy was quite in earnest, “I don’t believe
you’ve left anything <em>but</em> weeds in those rows.
It—it’s a knock-out!”
</p>
<p>
“Aw—I never,” gulped Sammy. “I guess I
know beets.”
</p>
<p>
“Huh! It looks as though you don’t even know
<em>beans</em>,” chortled Neale, unable to keep his gravity.
“What a mess! Mrs. McCall will be as sore
as she can be.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t care!” cried the tired boy wildly. “I
saved just what Aggie told me to, and threw away
everything else. And see how the rows are.”
</p>
<p>
“Why, Sammy, those aren’t where the rows of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36'></a>36</span>
beets were at all. See! <em>These</em> are beets. <em>Those</em>
are weeds. Oh, great grief!” and the older boy
went off into another gale of laughter.
</p>
<p>
“I—I do-o-on’t care,” wailed Sammy. “I did
just what Aggie told me to. And I want my half
dollar.”
</p>
<p>
“You want to be paid for wasting all Mrs. McCall’s
beets?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t care, I earned it.”
</p>
<p>
Neale could not deny the statement. As far as
the work went, Sammy certainly had spent time
and labor on the unfortunate task.
</p>
<p>
“Wait a minute,” said Neale, as Sammy started
away in anger. “Maybe all those beet plants you
pulled up aren’t wilted. We can save some of
them. Beets grow very well when they are transplanted—especially
if the ground is wet enough
and the sun isn’t too hot. It looks like rain for
to-night, anyway.”
</p>
<p>
“Aw—I—”
</p>
<p>
“Come on! We’ll get some water and stick out
what we can save. I’ll help you and the girls
needn’t know you were such a dummy.”
</p>
<p>
“Dummy, yourself!” snarled the tired and
over-wrought boy. “I’ll never weed another beet
again—no, I won’t!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37'></a>37</span>
</p>
<p>
Sammy made a bee-line out of the garden and
over the fence into Willow Street, leaving Neale
fairly shaking with laughter, yet fully realizing
how dreadfully cut-up Sammy must feel.
</p>
<p>
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
seem much greater to the mind of a youngster like
Sammy Pinkney than to an adult person. The
ridicule which he knew he must suffer because of
his mistake about the beet bed, seemed something
that he really could not bear. Besides, he had
worked all the afternoon for nothing (as he presumed)
and only the satisfaction of having earned
fifty cents would have counteracted the ache in
his muscles.
</p>
<p>
Harried by his disappointment, Sammy was met
by his mother in a stern mood, her first question
being:
</p>
<p>
“Where have you been wasting your time ever
since dinner, Sammy Pinkney? I never did see
such a lazy boy!”
</p>
<p>
It was true that he had wasted his time. But
his sore muscles cried out against the charge that
he was lazy.
</p>
<p>
He could not explain, however, without revealing
his shame. To be ridiculed was the greatest
punishment Sammy Pinkney knew.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38'></a>38</span>
</p>
<p>
“Aw, what do you want me to do, Maw? Work
<em>all</em> the time? Ain’t this my vacation?”
</p>
<p>
“But your father says you are to work enough
in the summer to keep from forgetting what work
is. And look how grubby you are. Faugh!”
</p>
<p>
“What do you want me to do, Maw?”
</p>
<p>
“You might do a little weeding in our garden,
you know, Sammy.”
</p>
<p>
“Weeding!” groaned the boy, fairly horrified
by the suggestion after what he had been through
that afternoon.
</p>
<p>
“You know very well that our onions and carrots
need cleaning out. And I don’t believe you
could even find our beets.”
</p>
<p>
“Beets!” Sammy’s voice rose to a shriek. He
never was really a bad boy; but this was too much.
“Beets!” cried Sammy again. “I wouldn’t
weed a beet if nobody ever ate another of ’em.
No, I wouldn’t.”
</p>
<p>
He darted by his mother into the house and ran
up to his room. Her reiterated command that he
return and explain his disgraceful speech and violent
conduct did not recall Sammy to the lower
floor.
</p>
<p>
“Very well, young man. Don’t you come down
to supper, either. And we’ll see what your father
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39'></a>39</span>
has to say about your conduct when he comes
home.”
</p>
<p>
This threat boded ill for Sammy, lying sobbing
and sore upon his bed. He was too desperate to
care much what his father did to him. But to
face the ridicule of the neighborhood—above all
to face the prospect of weeding another bed of
beets!—was more than the boy could contemplate.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll run away and be a pirate—that’s just
what I’ll do,” choked Sammy, his old obsession
enveloping his harassed thoughts. “I’ll show
’em! They’ll be sorry they treated me so—all of
’em.”
</p>
<p>
Just who “’em” were was rather vague in
Sammy Pinkney’s mind. But the determination
to get away from all these older people, whom he
considered had abused him, was not vague at all.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40'></a>40</span><a name='chIV' id='chIV'></a>CHAPTER IV—THE GYPSY TRAIL</h2>
<p>
Mr. Pinkney, Sammy’s father, heard all about
it before he arrived home, for he always passed
the side door of the old Corner House on his return
from business. He came at just that time
when Neale O’Neil was telling the assembled family—including
Mrs. McCall, Uncle Rufus, and
Linda the maid-of-all-work—about the utter
wreck of the beet bed.
</p>
<p>
“I’ve saved what I could—set ’em out, you
know, and soaked ’em well,” said the laughing
Neale. “But make up your mind, Mrs. McCall,
that you’ll have to buy a good share of your beets
this winter.”
</p>
<p>
“Well! What do you know about that, Mr.
Pinkney?” demanded Agnes of their neighbor,
who had halted at the gate.
</p>
<p>
“Just like that boy,” responded Mr. Pinkney,
shaking his head over his son’s transgressions.
</p>
<p>
“Just the same,” Neale added, chuckling,
“Sammy says you showed him which were weeds
and which were beets, Aggie.”
</p>
<p>
“Of course I did,” flung back the quick-tempered Agnes.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41'></a>41</span>
“And so did Uncle Rufus. But
that boy is so heedless—”
</p>
<p>
“I agree that Sammy pays very little attention
to what is told him,” said Sammy’s father.
</p>
<p>
Here Tess put in a soothing word, as usual:
“Of course he didn’t mean to pull up all your
beets, Mrs. McCall.”
</p>
<p>
“And I don’t like beets anyway,” proclaimed
Dot.
</p>
<p>
“He certainly must have worked hard,” Ruth
said, producing a fifty-cent piece and running
down the steps to press it into Mr. Pinkney’s
palm. “I am sure Sammy had no intention of
spoiling our beet bed. And I am not sure that it
is not partly our fault. He should not have been
left all the afternoon without some supervision.”
</p>
<p>
“He should be more observing,” said Mr.
Pinkney. “I never did see such a rattlebrain.”
</p>
<p>
“‘The servant is worthy of his hire,’” quoted
Ruth. “And tell him, Mr. Pinkney, that we forgive
him.”
</p>
<p>
“Just the same,” cried Agnes after their neighbor,
“although Sammy may know beans, as Neale
says, he doesn’t seem to know beets! Oh, what
a boy!”
</p>
<p>
So Mr. Pinkney brought home the story of
Sammy’s mistake and he and his wife laughed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42'></a>42</span>
over it. But when Mrs. Pinkney called upstairs
for the boy to come down to a late supper she got
only a muffled response that he “didn’t want no
supper.”
</p>
<p>
“He must be sick,” she observed to her husband,
somewhat anxiously.
</p>
<p>
“He’s sick of the mess he’s made—that’s all,”
declared Mr. Pinkney cheerfully. “Let him
alone. He’ll come around all right in the
morning.”
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile at the Corner House the Kenway
sisters had something more important (at least,
as they thought) to talk about than Sammy Pinkney
and his errors of judgment. What Dot had
begun to call the “fretful silver bracelet” was a
very live topic.
</p>
<p>
The local jeweler had pronounced the bracelet
of considerable value because of its workmanship.
It did not seem possible that the Gypsy women
could have dropped the bracelet into the basket
they had sold the smaller Corner House girls and
then forgotten all about it.
</p>
<p>
“It is not reasonable,” Ruth Kenway declared
firmly, “that it could just be a mistake. That basket
is worth two dollars at least; and they sold
it to the children for forty-five cents. It is mysterious.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43'></a>43</span>
</p>
<p>
“They seemed to like Tess and me a whole lot,”
Dot said complacently. “That is why they gave it
to us so cheap.”
</p>
<p>
“And that is the very reason I am worried,”
Ruth added.
</p>
<p>
“Why don’t you report it to the police?”
croaked Aunt Sarah Maltby. “Maybe they’ll try
to rob the house.”
</p>
<p>
“O-oh,” gasped Dot, round-eyed.
</p>
<p>
“Who? The police?” giggled Agnes in Ruth’s
ear.
</p>
<p>
“Maybe we ought to look again for those Gypsy
ladies,” Tess said. “But the bracelet is awful
pretty.”
</p>
<p>
“I tell you! Let’s ask June Wildwood. She
knows all about Gypsies,” cried Agnes. “She
used to travel with them. Don’t you remember,
Ruth? They called her Queen Zaliska, and she
made believe tell fortunes. Of course, not being
a real Gypsy she could not tell them very well.”
</p>
<p>
“Crickey!” ejaculated Neale O’Neil, who was
present. “You don’t believe in that stuff, do you,
Aggie?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know whether I do or not. But it’s
awfully thrilling to think of learning ahead what
is going to happen.”
</p>
<p>
“Huh!” snorted her boy friend. “Like the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44'></a>44</span>
weather man, eh? But he has some scientific data
to go on.”
</p>
<p>
“Probably the Gypsy fortune tellers have reduced
their business to a science, too,” Ruth
calmly said.
</p>
<p>
“Anyhow,” laughed Neale, “Queen Zaliska
now works in Byburg’s candy store. Some queen,
I’ll tell the world!”
</p>
<p>
“Neale!” admonished Ruth. “<em>Such</em> slang!”
</p>
<p>
“Come on, Neale,” said the excited Agnes.
“Let you and me go down to Byburg’s and ask
her about the bracelet.”
</p>
<p>
“I really don’t see how June can tell us anything,”
observed Ruth slowly.
</p>
<p>
“Anyway,” Agnes briskly said, putting on her
hat, “we need some candy. Come on, Neale.”
</p>
<p>
The Wildwoods were Southerners who had not
lived long in Milton. Their story is told in “The
Corner House Girls Under Canvas.” The Kenways
were very well acquainted with Juniper
Wildwood and her sister, Rosa. Agnes felt privileged
to question June about her life with the
Gypsies.
</p>
<p>
“I saw Big Jim in town the other day,” confessed
the girl behind the candy counter the moment
Agnes broached the subject. “I am awfully
afraid of him. I ran all the way home. And I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45'></a>45</span>
told Mr. Budd, the policeman on this beat, and I
think Mr. Budd warned Big Jim to get out of
town. There is some talk about getting a law
through the Legislature putting a heavy tax on
each Gypsy family that does not keep moving.
<em>That</em> will drive them away from Milton quicker
than anything else. And that Big Jim is a bad,
bad man. Why! he’s been in jail for stealing.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, my! He’s a regular convict, then,”
gasped Agnes, much impressed.
</p>
<p>
“Pshaw!” said Neale. “They don’t call a man
a convict unless he has been sent to the State
prison, or to the Federal penitentiary. But that
Big Jim looked to be tough enough, when we saw
him down at Pleasant Cove, to belong in prison
for life. Remember him, Aggie?”
</p>
<p>
“The children did not say anything about a
Gypsy man,” observed his friend. “There were
two Gypsy women.”
</p>
<p>
She went on to tell June Wildwood all about
the basket purchase and the finding of the silver
bracelet. The older girl shook her head solemnly
as she said:
</p>
<p>
“I don’t understand it at all. Gypsies are always
shrewd bargainers. They never sell things
for less than they cost.”
</p>
<p>
“But they made that basket,” Agnes urged.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46'></a>46</span>
“Perhaps it didn’t cost them so much as Ruth
thinks.”
</p>
<p>
June smiled in a superior way. “Oh, no, they
didn’t make it. They don’t waste their time nowadays
making baskets when they can buy them
from the factories so much cheaper and better.
Oh, no!”
</p>
<p>
“Crackey!” exclaimed Neale. “Then they are
fakers, are they?”
</p>
<p>
“That bracelet is no fake,” declared Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“That is what puzzles me most,” said June.
“Gypsies are very tricky. At least, all I ever
knew. And if those two women you speak of belonged
to Big Jim’s tribe, I would not trust them
at all.”
</p>
<p>
“But it seems they have done nothing at all bad
in this case,” Agnes observed.
</p>
<p>
“Tess and Dot are sure ahead of the game, so
far,” chuckled Neale in agreement.
</p>
<p>
“Just the same,” said June Wildwood, “I
would not be careless. Don’t let the children talk
to the Gypsies if they come back for the bracelet.
Be sure to have some older person see the women
and find out what they want. Oh, they are very
sly.”
</p>
<p>
June had then to attend to other customers, and
Agnes and Neale walked home. On the way they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47'></a>47</span>
decided that there was no use in scaring the little
ones about the Gypsies.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t believe in bugaboos,” Agnes declared.
“We’ll just tell Ruth.”
</p>
<p>
This she proceeded to do. But perhaps she did
not repeat June Wildwood’s warning against the
Gypsy band with sufficient emphasis to impress
Ruth’s mind. Or just about this time the older
Corner House girl had something of much graver
import to trouble her thought.
</p>
<p>
By special delivery, on this evening just before
they retired, arrived an almost incoherent letter
from Cecile Shepard, part of which Ruth read
aloud to Agnes:
</p>
<p style='margin-left: 2em;margin-right: 2em;'>
“... and just as Aunt Lorina is only beginning
to get better! I feel as though this family
is fated to have trouble this year. Luke was doing
so well at the hotel and the proprietor liked him.
It isn’t <em>his</em> fault that that outside stairway was
untrustworthy and fell with him. The doctor says
it is only a strained back and a broken wrist. But
Luke is in bed. I am going by to-morrow’s train
to see for myself. I don’t dare tell Aunt Lorina—nor
even Neighbor. Neighbor—Mr. Northrup—is
not well himself, and he would only worry
about Luke if he knew.... Now, don’t <em>you</em>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48'></a>48</span>
worry, and I will send you word how Luke is just
the minute I arrive.”
</p>
<p>
“But how can I help being anxious?” Ruth demanded
of her sister. “Poor Luke! And he was
working so hard this summer so as not to be
obliged to depend entirely on Neighbor for his
college expenses next year.”
</p>
<p>
Ruth was deeply interested in Luke Shepard—had
been, in fact, since the winter previous when
all the Corner House family were snowbound at
the Birdsall winter camp in the North Woods. Of
course, Ruth and Luke were both very young, and
Luke had first to finish his college course and get
into business.
</p>
<p>
Still and all, the fact that Luke Shepard had
been hurt quite dwarfed the Gypsy bracelet matter
in Ruth’s mind. And in that of Agnes, too,
of course.
</p>
<p>
In addition, the very next morning Mrs. Pinkney
ran across the street and in at the side door of
the Corner House in a state of panic.
</p>
<p>
“Oh! have you seen him?” she cried.
</p>
<p>
“Seen whom, Mrs. Pinkney?” asked Ruth with
sympathy.
</p>
<p>
“Is Buster lost again?” demanded Tess, poising
a spoonful of breakfast food carefully while
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49'></a>49</span>
she allowed her curiosity to take precedence over
the business of eating. “That dog always <em>is</em> getting
lost.”
</p>
<p>
“It isn’t Sammy’s dog,” wailed Mrs. Pinkney.
“It is Sammy himself. I can’t find him.”
</p>
<p>
“Can’t find Sammy?” repeated Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“His bed hasn’t been slept in! I thought he
was just sulky last night. But he is <em>gone</em>!”
</p>
<p>
“Well,” said Tess, practically, “Sammy is always
running away, you know.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, this is serious,” cried the distracted
mother. “He has broken open his bank and taken
all his money—almost four dollars.”
</p>
<p>
“My!” murmured Dot, “it must cost lots more
to run away and be pirates now than it used to.”
</p>
<p>
“Everything is much higher,” agreed Tess.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50'></a>50</span><a name='chV' id='chV'></a>CHAPTER V—SAMMY OCCASIONS MUCH EXCITEMENT</h2>
<p>
“I do hope and pray,” Aunt Sarah Maltby declared,
“that Mrs. Pinkney won’t go quite distracted
about that boy. Boys make so much trouble
usually that a body would near about believe
that it must be an occasion for giving thanks to
get rid of one like Sammy Pinkney.”
</p>
<p>
This was said of course after Sammy’s mother
had gone home in tears—and Agnes had accompanied
her to give such comfort as she might. The
whole neighborhood was roused about the missing
Sammy. All agreed that the boy never was of
so much importance as when he was missing.
</p>
<p>
“I do hope and pray that the little rascal will
turn up soon,” continued Aunt Sarah, “for Mrs.
Pinkney’s sake.”
</p>
<p>
“I wonder,” murmured Dot to Tess, “why it is
Aunt Sarah always says she ‘hopes and prays’?
Wouldn’t just praying be enough? You’re sure to
get what you pray for, aren’t you?”
</p>
<p>
“But what is the use of praying if you don’t
hope?” demanded Tess, the hair-splitting theologian.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51'></a>51</span>
“They must go together, Dot. I should
think you’d see that.”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Pinkney had lost hope of finding Sammy,
however, right at the start. She knew him of
course of old. He had been running away ever
since he could toddle out of the gate; but she and
Mr. Pinkney tried to convince themselves that
each time would be the last—that he was “cured.”
</p>
<p>
For almost always Sammy’s runaway escapades
ended disastrously for him and covered
him with ridicule. Particularly ignominious was
the result of his recent attempt, which is narrated
in the volume immediately preceding this, to accompany
the Corner House Girls on their canal-boat
cruise, when he appeared as a stowaway
aboard the boat in the company of Billy Bumps,
the goat.
</p>
<p>
“And he hasn’t even taken Buster with him this
time,” proclaimed Mrs. Pinkney. “He chained
Buster down cellar and the dog began to howl. So
mournful! It got on my nerves. I went down
after Mr. Pinkney went to business early this
morning and let Buster out. Then, because of
the dog’s actions, I began to suspect Sammy had
gone. I called him. No answer. And he hadn’t
had any supper last night either.”
</p>
<p>
“I am awfully sorry, Mrs. Pinkney,” Agnes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52'></a>52</span>
said. “It was too bad about the beets. But he
needn’t have run away because of <em>that</em>. Ruth sent
him his fifty cents, you know.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s just it!” exclaimed the distracted
woman. “His father did not give Sammy the
half dollar. As long as the boy was so sulky last
evening, and refused to come down to eat, Mr.
Pinkney said let him wait for that money till he
came down this morning. <em>He</em> thought Ruth was
too good. Sammy is always doing something.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, he’s not so bad,” said the comforting
Agnes. “I am sure there are lots worse boys.
And are you sure, Mrs. Pinkney, that he has really
run away this time?”
</p>
<p>
“Buster can’t find him. The poor dog has been
running around and snuffing for an hour. I’ve
telephoned to his father.”
</p>
<p>
“Who—<em>what</em>? Buster’s father?”
</p>
<p>
“Mr. Pinkney,” explained Sammy’s mother.
“I suppose he’ll tell the police. He says—Mr.
Pinkney does—that the police must think it is a
‘standing order’ on their books to find Sammy.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, my!” giggled Agnes, who was sure to appreciate
the comical side of the most serious situation.
“I should think the policemen would be so
used to looking for Sammy that they would pick
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53'></a>53</span>
him up anywhere they chanced to see him with the
idea that he was running away.”
</p>
<p>
“Well,” sighed Mrs. Pinkney, “Buster can’t
find him. There he lies panting over by the currant
bushes. The poor dog has run his legs off.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t believe bulldogs are very keen on a
scent. Our old Tom Jonah could do better. But
of course Sammy went right out into the street
and the scent would be difficult for the best dog
to follow. Do you think Sammy went early this
morning?”
</p>
<p>
“That dog began to howl soon after we went to
bed. Mr. Pinkney sleeps so soundly that it did
not annoy him. But I <em>knew</em> something was wrong
when Buster howled so.
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps I’m superstitious. But we had an
old dog that howled like that years ago when my
grandmother died. She was ninety-six and had
been bedridden for ten years, and the doctors said
of course that she was likely to die almost any
time. But that old Towser <em>did</em> howl the night
grandma was taken.”
</p>
<p>
“So you think,” Agnes asked, without commenting
upon Mrs. Pinkney’s possible trend
toward superstition, “that Sammy has been gone
practically all night?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54'></a>54</span>
</p>
<p>
“I fear so. He must have waited for his father
and me to go to bed. Then he slipped down the
back stairs, tied Buster, and went out by the cellar
door. All night long he’s been wandering somewhere.
The poor, foolish boy!”
</p>
<p>
She took Agnes up to the boy’s room—a museum
of all kinds of “useless truck,” as his mother
said, but dear to the boyish heart.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, he’s gone sure enough,” she said, pointing
to the bank which was supposed to be incapable
of being opened until five dollars in dimes
had been deposited within it. A screw-driver,
however, had satisfied the burglarious intent of
Sammy.
</p>
<p>
She pointed out the fact, too, that a certain extension
bag that had figured before in her son’s
runaway escapades was missing.
</p>
<p>
“The silly boy has taken his bathing suit and
that cowboy play-suit his father bought him. I
never did approve of that. Such things only give
boys crazy notions about catching dogs and little
girls with a rope, or shooting stray cats with a
popgun.
</p>
<p>
“Of course, he has taken his gun with him and
a bag of shot that he had to shoot in it. The gun
shoots with a spring, you know. It doesn’t use
real powder, of course. I have always believed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55'></a>55</span>
such things are dangerous. But, you know, his
father—
</p>
<p>
“Well, he wore his best shoes, and they will
hurt him dreadfully, I am sure, if he walks far.
And I can’t find that new cap I bought him only
last week.”
</p>
<p>
All the time she was searching in Sammy’s
closet and in the bureau drawers. She stood up
suddenly and began to peer at the conglomeration
of articles on the top of the bureau.
</p>
<p>
“Oh!” she cried. “It’s gone!”
</p>
<p>
“What is it, Mrs. Pinkney?” asked Agnes sympathetically,
seeing that the woman’s eyes were
overflowing again. “What is it you miss?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh! he is determined I am sure to run away
for good this time,” sobbed Mrs. Pinkney. “The
poor, foolish boy! I wish I had said nothing to
him about the beets—I do. I wonder if both his
father and I have not been too harsh with him.
And I’m sure he loves us. Just think of his taking
<em>that</em>.”
</p>
<p>
“But what is it?” cried Agnes again.
</p>
<p>
“It stood right here on his bureau propped up
against the glass. Sammy must have thought a
great deal of it,” flowed on the verbal torrent.
“Who would have thought of that boy being so
sentimental about it?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56'></a>56</span>
</p>
<p>
“Mrs. Pinkney!” begged the curious Agnes,
almost distracted herself now, “<em>do</em> tell me what
it is that is missing?”
</p>
<p>
“That picture. We had it taken—his father
and Sammy and me in a group together—the last
time we went to Pleasure Cove. Sammy begged to
keep it up here. And—now—the dear child—has—has
carried—it—away with him!”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Pinkney broke down utterly at this point.
She was finally convinced that at last Sammy had
fulfilled his oft-repeated threat to “run away for
good and all”—whether to be a pirate or not,
being a mooted question.
</p>
<p>
Agnes comforted her as well as she could. But
the poor woman felt that she had not taken her
son seriously enough, and that she could have
averted this present disaster in some way.
</p>
<p>
“She is quite distracted,” Agnes said, on arriving
home, repeating Aunt Sarah’s phrase.
“Quite distracted.”
</p>
<p>
“But if she is extracted,” Dot proposed, “why
doesn’t she have Dr. Forsyth come to see her?”
</p>
<p>
“Mercy, Dot!” admonished Tess. “<em>Dis</em>tracted,
not <em>ex</em>tracted. You do so mispronounce the commonest
words.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t, either,” the smaller girl denied vigorously.
“I don’t mispernounce any more than you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57'></a>57</span>
do, Tess Kenway! You just make believe you
know so much.”
</p>
<p>
“Dot! Mis<em>per</em>nounce! There you go again!”
</p>
<p>
This was a sore subject, and Ruth attempted to
change the trend of the little girls’ thoughts by
suggesting that Mrs. McCall needed some groceries
from a certain store situated away across
town.
</p>
<p>
“If you can get Uncle Rufus to harness Scalawag
you girls can drive over to Penny &amp; Marchant’s
for those things. And you can stop at Mr.
Howbridge’s house with this note. He must be
told about poor Luke’s injury.”
</p>
<p>
“Why, Ruthie?” asked little Miss Inquisitive,
otherwise Dot Kenway. “Mr. Howbridge isn’t
Luke Shepard’s guardian, too, is he?”
</p>
<p>
“Now, don’t be a chatterbox!” exclaimed the
elder sister, who was somewhat harassed on this
morning and did not care to explain to the little
folk just what she had in her mind.
</p>
<p>
Ruth was not satisfied to know that Cecile had
gone to attend her brother. The oldest Kenway
girl longed to go herself to the resort in the mountains
where Luke Shepard lay ill. But she did
not wish to do this without first seeking their
guardian’s permission.
</p>
<p>
Tess and Dot ran off in delight, forgetting their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58'></a>58</span>
small bickerings, to find Uncle Rufus. The old
colored man, as long as he could get about, would
do anything for “his chillun,” as he called the
four Kenway sisters. It needed no coaxing on the
part of Tess and Dot to get their will of the old
man on this occasion.
</p>
<p>
Scalawag was fat and lazy enough in any case.
In the spring Neale had plowed and harrowed the
garden with him and on occasion he was harnessed
to a light cart for work about the place. His
main duty, however, was to draw the smaller girls
about the quieter streets of Milton in a basket
phaeton. To this vehicle he was now harnessed
by Uncle Rufus.
</p>
<p>
“You want to be mought’ car’ful ‘bout them
automobiles, chillun,” the old man admonished
them. “Dat Sammy Pinkney boy was suah some
good once in a while. He was a purt’ car’ful
driber.”
</p>
<p>
“But he’s a good driver <em>now</em>—wherever he is,”
said Dot. “You talk as though Sammy would
never get back home from being a pirate. Of
course he will. He always does!”
</p>
<p>
Secretly Tess felt herself to be quite as able to
drive the pony as ever Sammy Pinkney was. She
was glad to show her prowess.
</p>
<p>
Scalawag shook his head, danced playfully on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59'></a>59</span>
the old stable floor, and then proceeded to wheel
the basket phaeton out of the barn and into Willow
Street. By a quieter thoroughfare than Main
Street, Tess Kenway headed him for the other
side of town.
</p>
<p>
“Maybe we’ll run across Sammy,” suggested
Dot, sitting sedately with her ever-present Alice-doll.
“Then we can tell his mother where he is
being a pirate. She won’t be so extracted then.”
</p>
<p>
Tess overlooked this mispronunciation, knowing
it was useless to object, and turned the subject
by saying:
</p>
<p>
“Or maybe we’ll see those Gypsies.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I hope not!” cried the smaller girl. “I
hope we’ll never see those Gypsy women again.”
</p>
<p>
For just at this time the Alice-doll was wearing
the fretted silver bracelet for a girdle.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60'></a>60</span><a name='chVI' id='chVI'></a>CHAPTER VI—THE GYPSY’S WORDS</h2>
<p>
That very forenoon after the two smallest girls
had set out on their drive with Scalawag a telegram
came to the old Corner House for Ruth.
</p>
<p>
As Agnes said, a telegram was “an event in
their young sweet lives.” And this one did seem
of great importance to Ruth. It was from Cecile
Shepard and read:
</p>
<p style='margin-left: 2em;margin-right: 2em;'>
“Arrived Oakhurst. They will not let me see Luke.”
</p>
<p>
Aside from the natural shock that the telegram
itself furnished, Cecile’s declaration that she was
not allowed to see her brother was bound to make
Ruth Kenway fear the worst.
</p>
<p>
“Oh!” she cried, “he must be very badly hurt
indeed. It is much worse than Cecile thought
when she wrote. Oh, Agnes! what shall I do?”
</p>
<p>
“Telegraph her for particulars,” suggested
Agnes, quite practically. “A broken wrist can’t
be such an awful thing, Ruthie.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61'></a>61</span>
</p>
<p>
“But his back! Suppose he has seriously hurt
his back?”
</p>
<p>
“Goodness me! That would be awful, of
course. He might grow a hump like poor Fred
Littleburg. But I don’t believe that anything like
that has happened to Luke, Ruthie.”
</p>
<p>
Her sister was not to be easily comforted.
“Think! There must be something very serious
the matter or they would not keep his own sister
from seeing him.” Ruth herself had had no word
from Luke since the accident.
</p>
<p>
Neither of the sisters knew that Cecile Shepard
had never had occasion to send a telegram before
and had never received one in all her life.
</p>
<p>
But she learned that a message of ten words
could be sent for thirty-two cents to Milton, so she
had divided what she wished to say in two equal
parts! The second half of her message, however,
because of the mistake of the filing clerk at the
telegraph office in Oakhurst, did not arrive at the
Corner House for several hours after the first half
of the message.
</p>
<p>
Ruth Kenway meanwhile grew almost frantic
as she considered the possible misfortune that
might have overtaken Luke Shepard. She grew
quite as “extracted”—to quote Dot—as Mrs.
Pinkney was about the absence of Sammy.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62'></a>62</span>
</p>
<p>
“Well,” Agnes finally declared, “if I felt as
you do about it I would not wait to hear from Mr.
Howbridge. I’d start right now. Here’s the time
table. I’ve looked up the trains. There is one
at ten minutes to one—twelve-fifty. I’ll call
Neale and he’ll drive you down to the station. You
might have gone with the children if that telegram
had come earlier.”
</p>
<p>
Agnes was not only practical, she was helpful
on this occasion. She packed Ruth’s bag—and
managed to get into it a more sensible variety of
articles than Sammy Pinkey had carried in his!
</p>
<p>
“Now, don’t be worried about <em>us</em>,” said Agnes,
when Ruth, dressed for departure, began to speak
with anxiety about domestic affairs, including the
continued absence of the little girls. “Haven’t
we got Mrs. McCall—and Linda? You <em>do</em> take
your duties so seriously, Ruth Kenway.”
</p>
<p>
“Do you think so?” rejoined Ruth, smiling
rather wanly at the flyaway sister. “If anything
should happen while I am gone—”
</p>
<p>
“Nothing will happen that wouldn’t happen
anyway, whether you are at home or not,” declared
the positive Agnes.
</p>
<p>
Ruth made ready to go in such a hurry that
nobody else in the Corner House save Agnes herself
realized that the older sister was going until
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63'></a>63</span>
the moment that Neale O’Neil drove around to the
front gate with the car. Then Ruth ran into Aunt
Sarah’s room to kiss her good-bye. But Aunt
Sarah had always lived a life apart from the general
existence of the Corner House family and
paid little attention to what her nieces did save
to criticise. Mrs. McCall was busy this day preserving—“up
tae ma eyen in wark, ma lassie”—and
Ruth kissed her, called good-bye to Linda, and
ran to the front door before any of the three
actually realized what was afoot.
</p>
<p>
Agnes ran with her to the street. At the gate
stood a dark-faced, brilliantly dressed young
woman, with huge gold rings in her ears, several
other pieces of jewelry worn in sight, and a flashing
smile as she halted the Kenway sisters with
outstretched hand.
</p>
<p>
“Will the young ladies let me read their
palms?” she said suavely. “I can tell them the
good fortune.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear me!” exclaimed Agnes, pushing by
the Gypsy. “We can’t stop to have our fortunes
told now.”
</p>
<p>
Ruth kept right on to the car.
</p>
<p>
“Do not neglect the opportunity of having the
good fortune told, young ladies,” said the Gypsy
girl shrewdly. “I can see that trouble is feared.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64'></a>64</span>
The dark young lady goes on a journey because
of the threat of <em>ill</em> fortune. Perhaps it is not so
bad as it seems.”
</p>
<p>
Agnes was really impressed. Left to herself
she actually would have heeded the Gypsy’s
words. But Ruth hurried into the car, Neale
reached back and slammed the tonneau door, and
they were off for the station with only a few minutes
to catch the twelve-fifty train.
</p>
<p>
“There!” ejaculated Agnes, standing at the
curb to wave her hand and look after the car.
</p>
<p>
“The blonde young lady does not believe the
Gypsy can tell her something that will happen—and
in the near future?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh!” exclaimed Agnes. “I don’t know.” And
she dragged her gaze from the car and looked
doubtfully upon the dark face of the Gypsy girl
which was now serious.
</p>
<p>
The latter said: “Something has sent the dark
young lady from home in much haste and
anxiety?”
</p>
<p>
The question was answered of course before it
was asked. Any observant person could have
seen as much. But Agnes’s interest was attracted
and she nodded.
</p>
<p>
“Had your sister,” the Gypsy girl said, guessing
easily enough at the relationship of the two
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65'></a>65</span>
Corner House girls, “not been in such haste, she
could have learned something that will change the
aspect of the threatened trouble. More news is
on the way.”
</p>
<p>
Agnes was quite startled by this statement.
Without explaining further the Gypsy girl glided
away, disappearing into Willow Street.
</p>
<p>
Agnes failed to see, as the Gypsy quite evidently
did, the leisurely approach of the telegraph
messenger boy with the yellow envelope in his
hand and his eyes fixed upon the old Corner
House.
</p>
<p>
Agnes ran within quickly. She was more than
a little impressed by the Gypsy girl’s words, and
a few minutes later when the front doorbell rang
and she took in the second telegram addressed to
Ruth, she was pretty well converted to fortune
telling as an exact science.
</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>
Sammy Pinkney had marched out of the house
late at night, as his mother suspected, lugging
his heavy extension-bag, with a more vague idea
of his immediate destination than was even usual
when he set forth on such escapades.
</p>
<p>
To “run away” seemed to Sammy the only
thing for a boy to do when home life and restrictions
became in his opinion unbearable. It might
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66'></a>66</span>
be questioned by stern disciplinarians if Mr. and
Mrs. Pinkney had properly punished Sammy
after he had run away the first few times, the boy
would not have been cured of his wanderlust.
</p>
<p>
Fortunately, although Sammy’s father was
stern enough, he very well knew that this desire
for wandering could not be beaten out of the boy.
Merely if he were beaten, when he grew big
enough to fend for himself in the world, he would
leave home and never return rather than face corporal
punishment.
</p>
<p>
“I was just such a kid when I was his age,”
admitted Mr. Pinkney. “My father licked me for
running away, so finally I ran away when I was
fourteen, and stayed away. Sammy has less
reason for leaving home than I had, and he’ll get
over his foolishness, get a better education than
I obtained, and be a better man, I hope, in the
end. It’s in the Pinkney blood to rove.”
</p>
<p>
This, of course, while perhaps being satisfactory
to a man, did not at all calm Sammy’s
mother. She expected the very worst to happen to
her son every time he disappeared; and as has
been shown on this occasion, the boy’s absence
stirred the community to its very dregs.
</p>
<p>
Had Mrs. Pinkney known that after tramping
as far as the outskirts of the town, and almost
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67'></a>67</span>
dropping from exhaustion, Sammy had gone to
bed on a pile of straw in an empty cow stable, she
would have been even more troubled than she was.
</p>
<p>
Sammy, however, came to no harm. He slept
so soundly in fact on the rude couch that it was
mid-forenoon before he awoke—stiff, sore in
muscles, clamorously hungry, and in a frame of
mind to go immediately home and beg for breakfast.
</p>
<p>
He had more money tied up in his handkerchief,
however, than he had ever possessed before when
he had run away. There was a store in sight at
the roadside not far ahead. He hid his bag in the
bushes and bought crackers, ham, cheese, and a
big bottle of sarsaparilla, and so made a hearty if
not judicious breakfast and lunch.
</p>
<p>
At least, this picnic meal cured the slight attack
of homesickness which he suffered. He was no
longer for turning back. The whole world was
before him and he strode away into it—lugging
that extension-bag.
</p>
<p>
While his troubled mother was showing Agnes
Kenway the unmistakable traces of his departure
for parts unknown, Sammy was trudging along
pretty contentedly, the bag awkwardly knocking
against his knees, and his sharp eyes alive to
everything that went on along the road.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68'></a>68</span>
</p>
<p>
Sammy had little love for natural history or
botany, or anything like that. He suffered preparatory
lessons in those branches of enforced
knowledge during the school year.
</p>
<p>
He did not care a bit to know the difference
between a gray squirrel and a striped chipmunk.
They both chattered at him saucily, and he stopped
to try a shot at each of them with his gun.
</p>
<p>
To Sammy’s mind they were legitimate game.
He visualized himself building a fire in a fence
corner, skinning and cleaning his game and roasting
it over the flames for supper. But the squirrel
and the chipmunk visualized quite a different outcome
to the adventure and they refused to be shot
by the amateur sportsman.
</p>
<p>
Sammy struck into a road that led across the
canal by a curved bridge and right out into a part
of the country with which he was not at all familiar.
The houses were few and far between, and
most of them were set well back from the road.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes dogs barked at him, but he was not
afraid of watch dogs. He did not venture into
the yards or up the private lanes. He had bought
enough crackers and cheese to make another meal
when he should want it. And there were sweet
springs beside the road, or in the pastures where
the cattle grazed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69'></a>69</span>
</p>
<p>
Few vehicles passed him in either direction. It
was the time of the late hay harvest and everybody
was at work in the fields—and usually when
he saw the haymakers at all, they were far from
the road.
</p>
<p>
He met no pedestrians at all. Being quite off
the line of the railroad, there were no tramps on
this road, and of course there was nothing else to
harm the boy. His mother, in her anxiety, peopled
the world with those that would do Sammy
harm. In truth, he was never safer in his life!
</p>
<p>
But adventure? Why, the world was full of it,
and Sammy Pinkney expected to meet any number
of exciting incidents as he went on.
</p>
<p>
“Sammy,” Dot Kenway once said, “has just
a <em>wunnerful</em> ’magination. Why! if he sees our
old Sandyface creeping through the grass after a
poor little field mouse, Sammy can think she’s a
whole herd of tigers. His ’magination is just
wunnerful!”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70'></a>70</span><a name='chVII' id='chVII'></a>CHAPTER VII—THE BRACELET AGAIN TO THE FORE</h2>
<p>
While Sammy’s sturdy, if short, legs were
leaving home and Milton steadily behind him, Dot
and Tess were driving Scalawag, the calico pony,
to Penny &amp; Marchant’s store, and later to Mr.
Howbridge’s house to deliver the note Ruth had
entrusted to them.
</p>
<p>
Their guardian had always been fond of the
Kenway sisters—since he had been appointed
their guardian by the court, of course—and Tess
and Dot could not merely call at Mr. Howbridge’s
door and drive right away again.
</p>
<p>
Besides, there were Ralph and Rowena Birdsall.
The Birdsall twins had of late likewise come
under Mr. Howbridge’s care, and circumstances
were such that it was best for their guardian to
take the twins into his own home.
</p>
<p>
Having two extremely active and rather willful
children in his household had most certainly disturbed
Mr. Howbridge out of the rut of his old
existence. And Ralph and Rowena quite “turned
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71'></a>71</span>
the ‘ouse hupside down,” to quote Hedden, Mr.
Howbridge’s butler.
</p>
<p>
The moment the twins spied Tess and Dot in
the pony phaeton they tore down the stairs from
their quarters at the top of the Howbridge house,
and flew out of the door to greet the little Corner
House girls.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Tessie and Dot!” cried Rowena, who
looked exactly like her brother, only her hair was
now grown long again and she no longer wore
boy’s garments, as she had when the Kenways
first knew her. “How nice to see you!”
</p>
<p>
“Where’s Sammy?” Ralph demanded. “Why
didn’t he come along, too?”
</p>
<p>
“We’re glad to see you, Rowena and Rafe,”
Tess said sedately.
</p>
<p>
But Dot replied eagerly to the boy twin:
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Rafe! what do you think? Sammy’s run
away again.”
</p>
<p>
“Get out!”
</p>
<p>
“I’m going to,” said Dot, considering Ralph’s
ejaculation of amazement an invitation to alight,
and she forthwith jumped down from the step of
the phaeton.
</p>
<p>
“You can’t mean that Sammy has run off?”
cried Ralph. “Listen to this, Rowdy.”
</p>
<p>
“What a silly boy!” criticised his sister.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72'></a>72</span>
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know,” chuckled Ralph Birdsall.
“’Member how you and I ran away that time,
Rowdy?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh—well,” said his sister. “We had reason
for doing so. But you know Sammy Pinkney’s
got a father and a mother—And for pity’s sake,
Rafe, stop calling me Rowdy.”
</p>
<p>
“And he’s got a real nice bulldog, too,” added
Dot, reflectively considering any possibility why
Sammy should run away. “I can’t understand
why he does it. He only has to come back home
again. I did it once, and I never mean to run
away from home again.”
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile Tess left Ralph to hitch Scalawag
while she marched up the stone steps of the
Howbridge house to deliver Ruth’s note into Hedden’s
hand, who took it at once to Mr. Howbridge.
</p>
<p>
Dot interested the twins almost immediately in
another topic. Rowena naturally was first to spy
the silver girdle around the Alice-doll’s waist.
</p>
<p>
“What a splendid belt!” cried Rowena Birdsall.
“Is it real silver, Dot?”
</p>
<p>
“It—it’s fretful silver,” replied the littlest
Corner House girl. “Isn’t it pretty?”
</p>
<p>
“Why,” declared Ralph after an examination,
“it’s an old, old bracelet.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, it is old, I s’pose,” admitted Dot. “But
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73'></a>73</span>
my Alice-doll doesn’t know that. <em>She</em> thinks it is
a brand new belt. But of course she can’t wear it
every day, for half the time the bracelet belongs
to Tess.”
</p>
<p>
This statement naturally aroused the twins’
curiosity, and when Tess ran back to join them in
the front yard the story of the Gypsy basket and
the finding of the bracelet lost nothing of detail
by being narrated by both of the Corner House
girls.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, my!” cried Rowena. “Maybe those
Gypsies are just waiting to grab you. Gypsies
steal children sometimes. Don’t they, Rafe?”
</p>
<p>
“Course they do,” agreed her twin.
</p>
<p>
Dot looked rather frightened at this suggestion,
but Tess scorned the possibility.
</p>
<p>
“Why, how foolish,” she declared. “Dot and
I were lost once—all by ourselves. Even Tom
Jonah wasn’t with us. Weren’t we, Dot? And we
slept out under a tree all night, and a nice Gypsy
woman found us in the morning and took us to
her camp. Didn’t she, Dot?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes! And an owl howled at us,” agreed
the smaller girl. “And I’d much rather sleep in
a Gypsy tent than have owls howl at me.”
</p>
<p>
“The owl <em>hooted</em>, Dot,” corrected Tess.
</p>
<p>
“Well, what’s the difference between a hoot and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74'></a>74</span>
a howl?” demanded Dot, rather crossly. She did
so hate to be corrected!
</p>
<p>
“Well, of course,” said Rowena Birdsall
thoughtfully, “if you are acquainted with Gypsies
maybe you wouldn’t be scared. But I don’t believe
they gave you this bracelet for nothing.”
</p>
<p>
“No,” agreed Dot quickly. “For forty-five
cents. And we still owe Sammy Pinkney twenty-five
cents of it. And he’s run away.”
</p>
<p>
So they got around again to the first exciting
piece of news Tess and Dot had brought, and were
discussing that when Mr. Howbridge came out to
speak to the little visitors, giving them his written
answer to Ruth’s note. He heard about Sammy’s
escapade and some mention of the Gypsies.
</p>
<p>
“Well,” he chuckled, “if Sammy Pinkney has
been carried off by the Gypsies, I sympathize with
the Gypsies. I have a very vivid recollection of
how much trouble Sammy can make—and without
half trying.
</p>
<p>
“Now, children, give my note to Ruth. I am
very sorry that Luke Shepard is ill. If he does
not at once recover it may be well to bring him
here to Milton. With his aunt only just recovering
from her illness, it would be unwise to take
the boy home.”
</p>
<p>
This he said more to himself than to the little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75'></a>75</span>
girls. Because of their errand Tess and Dot could
remain no longer. Ralph unhitched the pony and
Tess drove away.
</p>
<p>
Around the very first corner they spied a dusty,
rather battered touring-car just moving away. A
big, dark man, with gold hoops in his ears, was
driving it. There was a brilliantly dressed young
woman in the tonneau, which was otherwise filled
with boxes, baskets, a crate of fruit, and odd-shaped
packages.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Tess!” squealed Dot. “See there!”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Dot!” rejoined her sister quite as excitedly.
“That is the young Gypsy lady.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh-oo!” moaned Dot. “Have we <em>got</em> to give
her back this fretful silver bracelet, Tessie?”
</p>
<p>
“We must <em>try</em>,” declared Tess firmly. “Ruth
says so. Get up, Scalawag! Come on—hurry!
We must catch them.”
</p>
<p>
The touring-car was going away from the pony-phaeton.
Scalawag objected very much to going
faster than his usual easy jog trot—unless it were
to dance behind a band! <em>He</em> didn’t care to overtake
the Gypsies’ motor-car.
</p>
<p>
And that car was going faster and faster. Tess
stopped talking to the aggravating Scalawag and
lifted up her voice to shout after the Gypsies.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, stop! Stop!” she called. “Miss—Miss
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76'></a>76</span>
Gypsy! We’ve got something for you! Why,
Dot, you are not hollering at all!”
</p>
<p>
“I—I’m trying to,” wailed the smaller girl.
“But I do so hate to make Alice give up her belt.”
</p>
<p>
The Gypsy turned his car into a cross street
ahead and disappeared. When Scalawag brought
the Corner House girls to that corner the car was
so far away that the girls’ voices at their loudest
pitch could not have reached the ears of the
Romany folk.
</p>
<p>
“Now, just see! We’ll never be able to give that
bracelet back if you don’t do your share of the
hollering, Dot Kenway,” complained Tess.
</p>
<p>
“I—I will,” promised Dot. “Anyway, I will
when it’s your turn to wear the bracelet.”
</p>
<p>
The little girls reached home again at a time
when the whole Corner House family seemed disrupted.
To the amazement of Tess and Dot their
sister Ruth had departed for the mountains.
Neale had only just then returned from seeing
her aboard the train.
</p>
<p>
“And it’s too late to stop her, never mind what
Mr. Howbridge says in this note,” cried Agnes.
“That foolish Cecile! Here is the second half of
her telegraph message,” and she read it aloud
again:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77'></a>77</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-left: 2em;margin-right: 2em;'>
“Until afternoon; will wire you then how he is.”
</p>
<p>
“Crickey!” gasped Neale, red in the face with
laughter, and taking the two telegrams to read
them in conjunction:
</p>
<p style='margin-left: 2em;margin-right: 2em;'>
“Arrived Oakhurst. They will not let me see
Luke until afternoon. Will wire you then how
he is.”
</p>
<p>
“Isn’t that just like a girl?”
</p>
<p>
“No more like a girl than it is like a boy,”
snapped Agnes. “I’m sure all the brains in the
world are not of the masculine gender.”
</p>
<p>
“I stand corrected,” meekly agreed her friend.
“Just the same, I don’t think that even you,
Aggie, would award Cecile Shepard a medal for
perspicuity.”
</p>
<p>
“Why—<em>why</em>,” gasped the listening Dot, “has
Cecile got one of those things the matter with
her? I thought it was Luke who got hurt?”
</p>
<p>
“You are perfectly right, Dottie,” said Agnes,
before Neale could laugh at the little girl. “It <em>is</em>
Luke who is hurt. But this Neale O’Neil is very
likely to dislocate his jaw if he pronounces many
such big words. He is only showing off.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78'></a>78</span>
</p>
<p>
“Squelched!” admitted Neale good-naturedly.
“Well, what do you wish done with the car? Shall
I put it up? Can’t chase Ruth’s train in it, and
bring her back.”
</p>
<p>
“You might chase the Gypsies,” suggested
Tess slowly. “We saw them again—Dot and
me.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh! The Gypsies? What do you think,
Neale? I do believe there is something in that
fortune-telling business,” Agnes cried.
</p>
<p>
“I bet there is,” agreed Neale. “Money for the
Gypsies.”
</p>
<p>
But Agnes repeated what the Gypsy girl had
said to Ruth and herself just as the elder Corner
House girl was starting for the train.
</p>
<p>
“I saw that Gyp of course,” agreed Neale.
“But, pshaw! she only just <em>guessed</em>. Of course
there isn’t any truth in what those fortune tellers
hand you. Not much!”
</p>
<p>
“There was something in that basket they
handed Tess and me,” said Dot, complacently
eyeing the silver girdle on the Alice-doll.
</p>
<p>
“Say! About that bracelet, Aggie,” broke in
Neale. “Do you know what I believe?”
</p>
<p>
“What, Neale?”
</p>
<p>
“I believe those Gypsies must have stolen it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79'></a>79</span>
Then they got scared, thinking that the police
were after them, and the women dropped it into
the basket the kids bought, believing they could
get the bracelet back when it was safe for them
to do so.”
</p>
<p>
“Do you really suppose that is the explanation?”
</p>
<p>
“I am afraid the bracelet is ‘stolen goods.’
Perhaps the children had better not carry it away
from the house any more. Or until we are sure.
The police—”
</p>
<p>
“Mercy me, Neale! you surely would not tell
the police about the bracelet?”
</p>
<p>
“Not yet. But I was going to suggest to Ruth
that she advertise the bracelet in the Milton
<em>Morning Post</em>. Advertise it in the ‘Lost and
Found’ column, just as though it had been picked
up somewhere. Then let us see if the Gypsies—or
somebody else—comes after it.”
</p>
<p>
“And if somebody does?”
</p>
<p>
“Well, we can always refuse to give it up until
ownership is proved,” declared Neale.
</p>
<p>
“All right. Let’s advertise it at once. We
needn’t wait for Ruth to come back,” said the
energetic Agnes. “How should such an advertisement
be worded, Neale?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80'></a>80</span>
</p>
<p>
They proceeded to evolve a reading notice advertising
the finding of the silver bracelet, which
when published added not a little to the complications
of the matter.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81'></a>81</span><a name='chVIII' id='chVIII'></a>CHAPTER VIII—THE MISFORTUNES OF A RUNAWAY</h2>
<p>
In this present instance Sammy Pinkney was
not obliged to exert his imagination to any very
great degree to make himself believe that he was
having real adventure. Romance very soon took
the embryo pirate by the hand and led him into
most exciting and quite unlooked-for events.
</p>
<p>
Sammy’s progress was slow because of the
weight of the extension-bag. Yet as he trudged
on steadily he put a number of miles behind him
that afternoon.
</p>
<p>
Had his parents known in which direction to
look for him they might easily have overtaken the
runaway. Neale O’Neil could have driven out this
road in the Kenway’s car and brought Sammy
back before supper time.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Pinkney, however, labored under the delusion
that because Sammy was piratically inclined,
he would head toward the sea. So he got in touch
with people all along the railroad line to Pleasant
Cove, suspecting that the boy might have purchased
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82'></a>82</span>
a ticket in that direction with a part of
the contents of his burglarized bank.
</p>
<p>
The nearest thing to the sea that Sammy came
to after passing the canal on the edge of Milton
was a big pond which he sighted about mid-afternoon.
Its dancing blue waters looked very cool
and refreshing, and the young traveler thought of
his bathing suit right away.
</p>
<p>
“I can hide this bag and take a swim,” he
thought eagerly. “I bet that pond is all right.
Hullo! There’s some kids. I wonder if they
would steal my things if I go in swimming?”
</p>
<p>
He was not incautious. Being mischievously
inclined himself, he suspected other boys of having
similar propensities. The boys he had observed
were playing down by the water’s edge
where an ice-house had once stood. But the building
had been destroyed by fire, all but its roof.
The eaves of this shingled roof, which was quite
intact, now rested on the ground.
</p>
<p>
The boys were sliding from the ridge of the roof
to the ground, and then climbing up again to repeat
the performance. It looked to be a lot of fun.
</p>
<p>
After Sammy had hidden his extension-bag in
a clump of bushes, he approached the slide. One
boy, who was the largest and oldest of the group,
called to Sammy:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83'></a>83</span>
</p>
<p>
“Come on, kid. Try it. The slide’s free.”
</p>
<p>
It looked to be real sport, and Sammy could not
resist the invitation given so frankly. He saw
that the bigger boy sat on a piece of board when
he slid down the shingles; but the others slid on
the seat of their trousers—and so did Sammy.
</p>
<p>
It proved to be an hilarious occasion. One
might have heard those boys shouting and laughing
a mile away.
</p>
<p>
A series of races were held, and Sammy Pinkney
managed to win his share of them. This so
excited him that he failed for all of the time to
notice what fatal effect the friction was having
upon his trousers.
</p>
<p>
He was suddenly reminded, however, by a startling
happening. All the shingles on that roof
were not worn smooth. Some were “splintery.”
Sammy emitted a sharp cry as he reached the
ground after a particularly swift descent of the
roof, and rising, he clapped his hand to that part
of his anatomy upon which he had been tobogganing,
with a most rueful expression on his countenance.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, my! Oh, my!” cried Sammy. “I’ve got
two big holes worn right through my pants! My
good pants, too. My maw will give me fits, so she
will. I’ll never <em>dare</em> go home now.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84'></a>84</span>
</p>
<p>
The big boy who had saved his own trousers
from disaster by using the piece of board to slide
on, shouted with laughter. But another of the
party said to Sammy:
</p>
<p>
“Don’t tell your mother. I aren’t going to tell
<em>my</em> mother, you bet. By and by she’ll find the
holes and think they just wore through naturally.”
</p>
<p>
“Well,” said Sammy, with a sigh, “I guess I’ve
slid down enough for to-day, anyway. Good-bye,
you fellers, I’ll see you later.”
</p>
<p>
He did not feel at all as cheerful as he spoke.
He was really smitten with remorse, for this was
almost a new suit he had on. He wished heartily
that he had put on that cowboy suit—even his
bathing suit—before joining that coasting party.
</p>
<p>
“That big feller,” grumbled Sammy, “is a foxy
one, he is! He didn’t wear through his pants, you
bet. But <em>me</em>—”
</p>
<p>
Sammy was very much lowered in his own estimation
over this mishap. He was by no means so
smart as he had believed himself to be. He felt
gingerly from time to time of the holes in his
trousers. They were of such a nature that they
could scarcely be hidden.
</p>
<p>
“Crickey!” he muttered, “she sure will give
me fits.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85'></a>85</span>
</p>
<p>
The boys he had been playing with disappeared.
Sammy secured his bag and suddenly found it
very, very heavy. Evening was approaching.
The sun was so low now that its almost level rays
shone into his eyes as he plodded along the road.
</p>
<p>
A farmer going to Milton market in an auto-truck,
its load covered with a brown tarpaulin,
passed Sammy. If it had not been for the holes
in his trousers, and what his mother would do and
say about it, the boy surely would have asked the
farmer for a ride back home!
</p>
<p>
His hesitancy cost him the ride. And he met
nobody else on this road he was traveling. He
struggled on, his courage beginning to ebb. He
had eaten the last crumbs of his lunch. After the
pond was out of sight behind him the runaway saw
no dwellings at all. The road had entered a wood,
and that wood grew thicker and darker as he
advanced.
</p>
<p>
Fireflies twinkled in the bushes. There was a
hum of insect life and somewhere a big bullfrog
tuned his bassoon—a most eerie sound. A bat
flew low above his head and Sammy dodged, uttering
a startled squawk.
</p>
<p>
“Crickey! I don’t like this a bit,” he panted.
</p>
<p>
But the runaway was no coward. He was quite
sure that there was nothing in these woods that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86'></a>86</span>
would really hurt him. He could still see some
distance back from the road on either hand, and
he selected a big chestnut tree at the foot of which,
between two roots, there was a hollow filled with
leaves and trash.
</p>
<p>
This made not a bad couch, as he very soon
found. He thrust the bag that had become so
heavy farther into the hollow and lay down before
it. But tired as he was, he could not at once go
to sleep.
</p>
<p>
Somewhere near he heard a trickle of water.
The sound made the boy thirsty. He finally got
up and stumbled through the brush, along the
roadside in the direction of the running water.
</p>
<p>
He found it—a spring rising in the bank above
the road. Sammy carried a pocket-cup and soon
satisfied his thirst by its aid. He had some difficulty
in finding his former nest; but when he did
come to the hollow between two huge roots, with
the broadly spreading chestnut tree boughs overhead,
he soon fell asleep.
</p>
<p>
Nothing disturbed Sammy thereafter until it
was broad daylight. He awoke as much refreshed
as though he had slept in his own bed at home.
</p>
<p>
Young muscles recover quickly from strain. All
he remembered, too, was the fun he had had the
day before, while he was foot-loose. Even the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87'></a>87</span>
disaster to his trousers seemed of little moment
now. He had always envied ragged urchins; they
seemed to have so few cares and nobody to bother
them.
</p>
<p>
He ran with a whoop to the spring, drank his
fill from it, and then doused his face and hands
therein. The sun and air dried his head after his
ablutions and there was nobody to ask if “he had
washed behind his ears.”
</p>
<p>
He returned to the chestnut tree where he had
lain all night, whistling. Of course he was hungry;
but he believed there must be some house
along the road where he could buy breakfast.
Sammy Pinkney was not at all troubled by his situation
until, stooping to look into the cavity near
which he had slept, he made the disconcerting discovery
that his extension-bag was not there!
</p>
<p>
“Wha—wha—<em>what</em>?” stammered Sammy.
“It’s gone! Who took it?”
</p>
<p>
That he had been robbed while he went to the
spring was the only explanation there could be of
this mysterious disappearance. At least, so
thought Sammy.
</p>
<p>
He ran around the tree, staring all about—even
up into the thickly leaved branches where the
clusters of green burrs were already formed.
Then he plunged through the fringe of bushes into
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88'></a>88</span>
the road to see if he could spy the robber making
away in either direction.
</p>
<p>
All he saw was a rabbit hopping placidly across
the highway. A jay flew overhead with raucous
call, as though he laughed at the bereft boy. And
Sammy Pinkney was in no mood to stand being
laughed at!
</p>
<p>
“You mean old thing!” he shouted at the flashing
jay—which merely laughed at him again, just
as though he did know who had stolen Sammy’s
bag and hugely enjoyed the joke.
</p>
<p>
In that bag were many things that Sammy considered
precious as well as necessary articles of
clothing. There was his gun and the shot for it!
How could he defend himself from attack or shoot
game in the wilds, if either became necessary?
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear!” Sammy finally sniffed, not above
crying a few tears as there was nobody by to see.
“Oh, dear! Now I’ve <em>got</em> to wear this good suit—although
’tain’t so good anyway with holes in
the pants.
</p>
<p>
“But all my other things—crickey! Ain’t it
just mean? Whoever took my bag, I hope he’ll
have the baddest kind of luck. I—I hope he’ll
have to go to the dentist’s and have all his teeth
pulled, so I do!” which, from a recent experience
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89'></a>89</span>
of the runaway, seemed the most painful punishment
that could be exacted from the thief.
</p>
<p>
Wishing any amount of ill-fortune for the robber
would not bring back his bag. Sammy quite
realized this. He had his money safely tied into
a very grubby handkerchief, so that was all right.
But when he started off along the road at last, he
was in no very cheerful frame of mind.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90'></a>90</span><a name='chIX' id='chIX'></a>CHAPTER IX—THINGS GO WRONG</h2>
<p>
Of course there was no real reason why life at
the old Corner House should not flow quite as
placidly with Ruth away as when the elder sister
was at home. It was a fact, however, that things
seemed to begin to go wrong almost at once.
</p>
<p>
Having written the notice advertising the silver
bracelet as though it had been found by chance,
Agnes made Neale run downtown again at once
with it so as to be sure the advertisement would
be inserted in the next morning’s <em>Post</em>.
</p>
<p>
As the automobile had not been put into the
garage after the return from taking Ruth to the
station, Neale used it on this errand, and on his
way back there was a blowout. Of course if Ruth
had been at home she could scarcely have averted
this misfortune. However, had she been at home
the advertisement regarding the bracelet might
not have been written at all.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, Mrs. McCall’s preserve jars did not
seal well, and the next day the work had to be done
all over again. Linda cut her finger “to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91'></a>91</span>
bone,” as she gloomily announced. And Uncle
Rufus lost a silver dollar somewhere in the grass
while he was mowing the lawn.
</p>
<p>
“An’ dollars is as scarce wid me as dem hen’s
teef dey talks about,” said the old darkey. “An’
I never yet did see a hen wid teef—an’ Ah reckon
I’ve seen a million of ’em.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh-oo!” murmured Dot Kenway. “A million
hens, Unc’ Rufus? <em>Is</em> there that many?”
</p>
<p>
“He, he!” chuckled the old man. “Ain’t that
the beatenes’ chile dat ever was? Always a-questionin’
an’ a-questionin’. Yo’ can’t git by wid any
sprodigious statement when she is around—no,
suh!”
</p>
<p>
Nor could such an expression as “sprodigious”
go unchallenged with Dot on the scene—no, indeed!
A big word in any case attracted Miss
Dorothy.
</p>
<p>
“What does that mean, Unc’ Rufus?” she
promptly demanded. “Is—is ‘sprodigious’ a dictionary
word, or just one of your made-up
words?”
</p>
<p>
“Go ‘long chile!” chuckled the old man.
“Can’t Uncle Rufus make up words just as good
as any dictionary-man? If I knows what Ah
wants to say, Ah says it, ne’er mind de
dictionary!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92'></a>92</span>
</p>
<p>
“That’s all very well, Unc’ Rufus,” Tess put
in. “But Ruthie only wants us to use language
that you find in books. So I guess you’d better
not take that one from Uncle Rufus, Dottie.”
</p>
<p>
“Howcome Missy Ruth so pertic’lar?” grumbled
the old man. “Yo’ little gals is gettin’ too
much l’arnin’—suah is! But none of hit don’t
find de ol’ man his dollar.”
</p>
<p>
At this complaint Tess and Dot went to work
immediately to hunt for the missing dollar. It
was while they were searching along the hedgerow
next to the Creamers’ premises that the little
girls got into their memorable argument with
Mabel Creamer about the lobster—an argument,
which, being overheard by Agnes, was reported
to the family with much hilarity.
</p>
<p>
Mabel, an energetic and sharp-tongued child,
and Bubby, her little brother, were playing in
their yard. That is, Bubby was playing while
Mabel nagged and thwarted him in almost everything
he wanted to do.
</p>
<p>
“Now, don’t stoop over like that, Bubby. Your
face gets all red like a lobster does. Maybe you’ll
turn into one.”
</p>
<p>
“I <em>ain’t</em> a lobs’er,” shouted Bubby.
</p>
<p>
“You will be one if you get red like that,” repeated
his sister in a most aggravating way.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93'></a>93</span>
</p>
<p>
“I won’t be a lobs’er!” wailed Bubby.
</p>
<p>
“Of course you won’t be a lobster, Bubby,”
spoke up Tess from across the hedge. “You’re
just a boy.”
</p>
<p>
“Course I’s a boy,” declared Bubby stoutly,
sensing that Tess Kenway’s assurance was half
a criticism. “I don’t want to be a lobs’er—nor
a dirl, so there!”
</p>
<p>
“Oh-oo!” gasped Dot.
</p>
<p>
“You will be a lobster and turn all red if you
are a bad boy,” declared Mabel, who was always
in a bad temper when she was made to mind
Bubby.
</p>
<p>
“Why, Mabel,” murmured Dot, who knew a
thing or two about lobsters herself, “you wouldn’t
boil Bubby, would you?”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t have to boil ’em to make ’em turn red,”
declared Mabel, referring to the lobster, not the
boy. “My father brought home live lobsters once
and the big one got out of the basket on to the
kitchen floor.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, my!” exclaimed the interested Dot.
“What happened?”
</p>
<p>
With her imagination thus spurred by appreciation,
Mabel pursued the fancy: “And there
were three little ones in the basket, and that old,
big lobster tried to make them get out on the floor
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94'></a>94</span>
too. And when they wouldn’t, what do you
think?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know,” breathed Dot.
</p>
<p>
“Why, he got so mad at them that he turned red
all over. I saw him—”
</p>
<p>
“Why, Mabel Creamer!” interrupted Tess, unable
to listen further to such a flight of fancy without
registering a protest. “That can’t be so—you
know it can’t.”
</p>
<p>
“I’d like to know why it can’t be so?” demanded
Mabel.
</p>
<p>
“’Cause lobsters only turn red when they are
boiled. They are all green when they are alive.”
</p>
<p>
“How do you know so much, Tess Kenway?”
cried Mabel. “These are my lobsters and I’ll
have them turn blue if I want to—so there!”
</p>
<p>
There seemed to be no room for further argument.
Besides, Mabel grabbed Bubby by the
hand and dragged him away from the hedge.
</p>
<p>
“My!” murmured Dot, “Mabel has <em>such</em> a
‘magination. And maybe that lobster did get
mad, Tess. We don’t know.”
</p>
<p>
“She never had a live lobster in her family,”
declared Tess, quite emphatically. “You know
very well, Dot Kenway, that Mr. Creamer
wouldn’t bring home such a thing as a live lobster,
when there are little children in his house.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95'></a>95</span>
</p>
<p>
“M—mm—I guess that’s so,” agreed Dot. “A
live lobster would be worse than Sammy Pinkney’s
bulldog.”
</p>
<p>
Thus reminded of the absent Sammy the two
smaller Corner House girls postponed any further
search for Uncle Rufus’s dollar and went across
the street to learn if any news had been gained of
their runaway playmate. Mrs. Pinkney was still
despairing. She had imagined already a score of
misfortunes that might have befallen her absent
son, ranging from his eating of green apples to
being run over by an automobile.
</p>
<p>
“But, Mrs. Pinkney!” burst forth Tess at last,
“if Sammy has run away to sea to be a pirate,
there won’t be any green apples for him to eat—and
no automobiles.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, you can never tell what trouble Sammy
Pinkney will manage to get into,” moaned his
mother. “I can only expect the very worst.”
</p>
<p>
“Well,” Dot remarked with a sigh, as she and
Tess trudged home to supper, “I’m glad there
is only one boy in <em>my</em> family. My boy doll, Nosmo
King Kenway, will probably be a source of great
anxiety when he is older.”
</p>
<p>
“I wouldn’t worry about that,” Tess told her
placidly. “If he is very bad you can send him
to the reform school.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96'></a>96</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh—oo!” gasped Dot, all her maternal instincts
aroused at such a suggestion. “That
would be awful.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know. They do send boys to the reform
school. Jimmy Mulligan, whose mother
lives in that little house on Willow Wythe, is in
the reform school because he wouldn’t mind his
mother.”
</p>
<p>
“But they don’t send Sammy there,” urged
Dot.
</p>
<p>
“No—o. Of course,” admitted the really tender-hearted
Tess, “we know Sammy isn’t really
naughty. He is only silly to run away every once
in a while.”
</p>
<p>
There was much bustle inside the old Corner
House that evening. Because they really missed
Ruth so much, her sisters invented divers occupations
to fill the hours until bedtime. Tess and
Dot, for instance, had never cut out so many
paper-dolls in all their lives.
</p>
<p>
Another telegram had arrived from Cecile
Shepard (sent, of course, before Ruth had reached
Oakhurst), stating that she had been allowed to
see her brother and that, although he could not
be immediately moved, he was improving and was
absolutely in no danger.
</p>
<p>
“If Ruthie had only waited to get <em>this</em> message,”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97'></a>97</span>
complained Agnes, “she would not have
gone up there to the mountains at all. And just
see, Neale, how right that Gypsy girl was. There
was news on the way that changed the whole
aspect of affairs. She was quite wonderful, <em>I</em>
think.”
</p>
<p>
By this time Neale saw that it was better not
to try to ridicule Agnes’ budding belief in fortune
telling. “Less said, the soonest mended,”
was his wise opinion.
</p>
<p>
“I like Cecile Shepard,” Agnes went on to say,
“and always shall; but I don’t think she has
shown much sense about her brother’s illness.
Scaring everybody to death, and sending telegrams
like a patch-work quilt!”
</p>
<p>
“Maybe Ruth will come right home again when
she finds Luke is all right,” said Tess hopefully.
“Dear, me! aren’t boys a lot of trouble?”
</p>
<p>
“Sammy and Luke are,” agreed Dot.
</p>
<p>
“All but Neale,” said the loyal Agnes, her boy
chum having departed. “I don’t see what this
family would do without Neale O’Neil.”
</p>
<p>
In the morning the older sister’s absence
seemed to make quite as great a gap in the household
of the old Corner House as at night. But
Neale rushed in early with the morning paper to
show Agnes their advertisement in print. Under
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98'></a>98</span>
the “Lost and Found” heading appeared the
following:
</p>
<p style='margin-left: 2em;margin-right: 4em;'>
“FOUND:—Silver bracelet, antique design.
Owner can regain it by proving property and paying
for this advertisement. Apply Kenway, Willow
and Main Streets.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“It sounds quite dignified,” decided Agnes admiringly.
“I guess Ruth would approve.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Crickey!” ejaculated Neale O’Neil, “this is
<em>one</em> thing Ruth is not bossing. We did this off
our own bat, Aggie.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Just the same,” ruminated Agnes, “I wonder
what Mr. Howbridge will say if he reads it?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I am glad,” said Neale with gratitude, “that
my father doesn’t interfere with what I do. And
I haven’t any guardian, unless it is dear old Con
Murphy. Folks let me pretty much alone.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“If they didn’t,” said Agnes saucily, “I suppose
you would run away as you did from the
circus.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“No,” laughed her chum. “One runaway in
the neighborhood is enough. Mr. Pinkney has been
up half the night, he tells me, telephoning and
sending telegrams. He has about made up his
mind that Sammy hasn’t gone in the direction of
Pleasant Cove, after all.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99'></a>99</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“We ought to help hunt for Sammy,” cried
Agnes eagerly. “Let us take Mrs. Pinkney in
the auto, Neale, and search for that little rascal.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“No. She will not leave the house. She wants
to greet Sammy when he comes back—no matter
whether it is day or night,” chuckled Neale. “But
Mr. Pinkney is going to get away from the office
this afternoon, and we’ll take him. He is afraid
his wife will be really ill.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Poor woman!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“She cannot be contented to sit down and wait
for Sammy to turn up—as he always does.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“You mean, he always gets turned up,” giggled
Agnes. “Somebody is sure to find him.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Well, then, it might as well be us,” agreed
Neale. “I’ll tune up the engine, and see that the
car is all right. We should be able to go over a
lot of these roads in an afternoon. Sammy could
not have got very far from Milton in two days,
or less.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100'></a>100</span><a name='chX' id='chX'></a>CHAPTER X—ALL IS NOT GOLD THAT GLITTERS</h2>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Quite unsuspicious of the foregoing plans for
his apprehension, Sammy Pinkney was journeying
on, going steadily away from Milton, and traveling
much faster now that he did not have to carry
the extension-bag.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
The boy had no idea who could have stolen his
possessions; but he rubbed his knuckles in his
eyes, forced back the tears, and pressed on, feeling
that freedom even without a change of garments
was preferable to the restrictions of home and all
the comforts there to be found.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
He walked two miles or more and was very
hungry before he came to the first house. It stood
just at the edge of the big wood in which Sammy
had spent the night.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
It was scarcely more than a tumbled-down hut,
with broken panes of glass more common than
whole ones in the windows, these apertures stuffed
with hats and discarded garments, while half the
bricks had fallen from the chimney-top. There
were half a dozen barefooted children running
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101'></a>101</span>
about, while a very wide and red-faced woman
stood in the doorway.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Hullo, me bye!” she called to Sammy, as he
lingered outside the broken fence with a longing
eye upon her. “Where be yez bound so airly in
the marnin’?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I’m just traveling, Ma’am,” Sammy returned
with much dignity. “Could—could you sell me
some breakfast?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Breakfast, is it?” repeated the smiling
woman. “Shure, I’d give yez it, if mate wasn’t
so high now. Come in me kitchen and sit ye down.
There’s tay in the pot, and I’ll fry yez up a spider
full o’ pork and taters, if that’ll do yez?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
The menu sounded tempting indeed to Sammy.
He accepted the woman’s invitation instantly and
entered the house, past the staring children. The
two oldest of the group, a shrewd-faced boy and
a sharp-featured girl, stood back and whispered
together while they watched the visitor.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Sammy was so much interested in the bountiful
breakfast with which the housewife supplied him
that he thought very little about the children peering
in at the door and open windows. When he
had eaten the last crumb he asked his hostess how
much he should pay her.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Well, me bye, I’ll not overcharge ye,” she replied.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102'></a>102</span>
“If yez have ten cents about ye we’ll call
it square—an’ that’s only for the mate, as I said
before is so high, I dunno.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Sammy produced the knotted handkerchief, put
it on the table and untied it, displaying the coins
it held with something of a flourish. The jingle
of so many dimes brought a sigh of wonder in
unison from the young spectators at door and
windows. The woman accepted her dime without
comment.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Sammy thanked her politely, wiped his mouth
on his sleeve (napery was conspicuous by its
absence in this household) and started out the
door. The smaller children scattered to give him
passage; the older boy and girl had already gone
out of the badly fenced yard and were loitering
along the road in the direction Sammy was
traveling.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Hullo! Here’s raggedy-pants,” said the girl
saucily, when Sammy came along.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“How did you get them holes in your breeches,
kid?” added the boy.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Never you mind,” rejoined Sammy gruffly.
“They’re <em>my</em> pants.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Stuck up, ain’t you?” jeered the girl and
stuck out her tongue at him.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Sammy thought these were two very impolite
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103'></a>103</span>
children, and although he was not rated at home
for his own chivalrous conduct, he considered
these specimens in the road before him quite unpleasant
young people.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Ne’er mind,” said the boy, looking at Sammy
slyly, “he don’t know everything. He ain’t seen
everything if he is traveling all by himself. I bet
he’s run away.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I ain’t running away from you,” was Sammy’s
belligerent rejoinder.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“You would if I said ‘Boo!’ to you.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“No, I wouldn’t.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Ya!” scoffed the girl, leering at Sammy,
“don’t talk so much. Do something to him,
Peter.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Peter glanced warily back at the house. Perhaps
he knew the large, red-faced woman might
take a hand in proceedings if he pitched upon the
strange boy.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I bet,” he said, starting on another tack, “that
he never saw a cherry-colored calf like our’n.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I bet he never did,” crowed the girl in delight.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“A cherry-colored calf,” scoffed Sammy. “Get
out! There ain’t such a thing. A calf might be
red; there <em>are</em> red cows—”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“This calf is cherry-colored,” repeated the boy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104'></a>104</span>
earnestly. “It’s down there in our pasture.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Don’t believe it,” said Sammy flatly.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“’Tis so!” cried the girl.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I tell you,” said the very shrewd-looking boy.
“We’ll show it to you for ten cents.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I don’t believe it,” repeated Sammy, but more
doubtfully.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
The girl laughed at him more scornfully than
before. “He’s afraid to spend a dime—an’ him
with so much money,” she cried.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I don’t believe you’ve got a cherry-colored
calf to show me.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Gimme the dime and I’ll show you whether
we have or not,” said Peter.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“No,” said the cautious Sammy. “I’ll give you
a dime <em>if</em> you show it to me. But no foolin’. I
won’t give you a cent if the calf is any other
color.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“All right,” shouted the other boy. “Come on
and I’ll show you. Come on, Liz.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“All right, Peter,” said the girl, quite as eagerly.
“Hurry up, raggedy-pants. We can use
that dime, Peter and me can.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
The bare-legged youngsters got through a rail
fence and darted down a path into a scrubby pasture,
as wild as unbroken colts. Sammy, feeling
fine after the bountiful breakfast he had eaten,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105'></a>105</span>
chased after them wishing that he had thought
to remove his shoes and stockings too. Peter and
Liz seemed so much more free and untrammeled
than he!
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Hold on!” puffed Sammy, coming finally to
the bottom of the slope. “I ain’t going to run
my head off for any old calf—Huh!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
From behind a clump of brush appeared suddenly
a cow—a black and white cow, probably of
the Holstein breed. There followed a scrambling
in the bushes. Liz jumped into them with a shriek
and drove out a little, blatting, stiff-legged calf.
It was all of a glossy black, from its nose to the
tip of its tail.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“That’s him! That’s him!” shrieked Liz. “A
cherry-colored calf.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“What did I tell you?” demanded the boy,
Peter. “Give us the dime.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“You go on!” exclaimed Sammy. “I knew all
the time you were story-telling. That’s no cherry-colored
calf.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“’Tis too! It’s just the color of a black-heart
cherry,” giggled Liz. “You got to give up ten
cents.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Won’t neither,” Sammy declared.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I’ll take it off you,” threatened Peter, growing
belligerent.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106'></a>106</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“You won’t,” stubbornly declared Sammy, who
did not propose to be cheated.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Peter jumped for him and Sammy could not
run. One reason why he could not retreat was
because Liz grabbed him from the rear, holding
him around the waist.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
She pulled him over backward, while her
brother began to pummel Sammy most heartily
from above. It was a most unfair attack and a
most uncomfortable situation for the runaway.
Although he managed to defend his face for the
most part from Peter’s blows, he could do little
else.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Lemme up! Lemme up!” bawled Sammy.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Gimme the dime,” panted Peter.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I won’t! ’Tain’t fair!” gasped Sammy, too
plucky to give in.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Liz had now squirmed from under the struggling
boys. She must have seen at the house in
which pocket Sammy kept the knotted handkerchief,
for she thrust her hand into that pocket and
snatched out the hoard of dimes before the owner
realized what she was doing.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Hey! Stop! Lemme up!” roared Sammy
again.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I got it, Peter!” shrieked Liz, and, springing
up, she darted into the bushes and disappeared.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107'></a>107</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Stop! She’s stole my money,” gasped Sammy
in horror and alarm.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“She never! You didn’t have no money!” declared
Peter, and with a final blow that stunned
Sammy for the moment, the other leaped up and
followed his wild companion into the brush.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Sammy, weeping in good earnest now, bruised
and scratched in body and sore in spirit, climbed
slowly to his feet. Never before in any of his
runaway escapades had he suffered such ignominy
and loss.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Why! he had actually fallen among thieves.
First his bag and all his chattels therein had been
stolen. Now these two ragamuffins had robbed
him of every penny he possessed.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
He dared not go back to the house where he
had bought breakfast and complain. The other
youngsters there might fall upon and beat him
again!
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Sammy Pinkney at last was tasting the bitter
fruits of wrong doing. Even weeding another
beet-bed could have been no more painful than
these experiences which he was now suffering.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108'></a>108</span><a name='chXI' id='chXI'></a>CHAPTER XI—MYSTERIES ACCUMULATE</h2>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“And if you go to the store, or anywhere else
for Mrs. McCall or Linda, remember <em>don’t</em> take
that bracelet with you,” commanded Agnes in a
most imperative manner, fairly transfixing her
two smaller sisters with an index finger. “Remember!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Ruthie didn’t say so,” complained Dot. “Did
she, Tess?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“But I guess we’d better mind what Agnes says
when Ruth isn’t at home,” confessed Tess, more
amenable to discipline. “You know, Aggie has
got to be responsible now.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Well,” muttered the rebellious Dot, “never
mind if she is ‘sponserble, she needn’t be so awful
bossy about it!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Agnes did, of course, feel her importance while
Ruth was away. It was not often that she was
made responsible for the family welfare in any
particular. And just now the matter of the silver
bracelet loomed big on her horizon.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109'></a>109</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
She scarcely expected the advertisement in the
<em>Morning Post</em> to bring immediate results. Yet, it
might. The Gypsies’ gift to the little girls was
a very queer matter indeed. The suggestion that
the bracelet had been stolen by the Romany folk
did not seem at all improbable.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
And if this was so, whoever had lost the ornament
would naturally be watching the “Lost and
Found” column in the newspaper.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Unless the owner doesn’t know he has lost it,”
Agnes suggested to Neale.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“How’s that? He’d have to be more absent-minded
than Professor Ware not to miss a bracelet
like that,” scoffed her boy chum.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh, Professor Ware!” giggled Agnes, suddenly.
“<em>He</em> would forget anything, I do believe.
Do you know what happened at his house the
other evening when the Millers and Mr. and Mrs.
Crandall went to call?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“The poor professor made a bad break I suppose,”
grinned Neale. “What did he do?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Why, Mrs. Ware saw the callers coming just
before they rang the bell and the professor had
been digging in the garden. Of course she
straightened things up a little before she appeared
in the parlor to welcome the visitors. But the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110'></a>110</span>
professor did not appear. Somebody asked for
him at last and Mrs. Ware went to the foot of the
stairs to call him.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“‘Oh, Professor!’ she called up the stairs, and
the company heard him answer back just as plain:
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“‘Maria, I can’t remember whether you sent
me up here to change my clothes or to go to bed.’”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I can believe it!” chortled Neale O’Neil. “He
has made some awful breaks in school. But I
don’t believe <em>he</em> ever owned that bracelet, Aggie.”

The first person who displayed interest in the
advertisement in the <em>Post</em> about the bracelet, save
the two young people who put it in the paper,
proved to add much to the mystery of the affair
and nothing at all to the peace of mind of Agnes,
at least.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Agnes was busy at some mending—actually
hose-darning, for Ruth insisted that the flyaway
sister should mend her own stockings, which Aunt
Sarah’s keen eyes inspected—when she chanced
to raise her head to glance out of the front window
of the sewing room. A strange looking turnout
had halted before the front gate.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
The vehicle itself was a decrepit express wagon
on the side of which in straggling blue letters was
painted the one word “JUNK,” but the horse
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111'></a>111</span>
drawing the wagon was a surprisingly well-kept
and good looking animal.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
The back of the wagon was piled high with
bundles of newspapers, and bags, evidently stuffed
with rags, were likewise in the wagon body. The
man climbing down from the seat just as Agnes
looked did not seem at all like the usual junk
dealer who passed through Milton’s streets heralded
by a “chime” of tin-can bells.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
He was a small, swarthy man, and even at the
distance of the front gate from Agnes’ window
the girl could see that he wore gold hoops in his
ears. He was quick but furtive in his motions.
He glanced in a birdlike way down the street and
across the Parade Ground, which was diagonally
opposite the old Corner House, before he entered
the front gate.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“He’d better go around to the side door,”
thought Agnes aloud. “He must be a very fashionable
junkman to come to the front of the house.
And at that I don’t believe Mrs. McCall has any
rags or papers to sell just now.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
The swarthy man came straight on to the porch
and up the steps. Agnes heard the bell, and knowing
Linda was busy and being likewise rather
curious, she dropped her stocking darning and ran
into the front hall.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112'></a>112</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
The moment she unlatched the big door the
swarthy stranger inserted himself into the house.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Why! who are you?” she demanded, fairly
thrust aside by the man’s eagerness.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
She saw then that he had a folded paper in
one hand. He thrust it before her eyes, pointing
to a place upon it with a very grimy finger.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“You have found it!” he chattered with great
excitement. “That ancient bracelet which has for
so many generations been an heirloom—yes?—of
the Costello. Queen Alma herself wore it at a
time long ago. You have found it?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Agnes was made almost speechless by his vehemence
as well as by the announcement itself.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I—I—What <em>do</em> you mean?” she finally
gasped.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“You know!” he ejaculated, rapping on the
newspaper with his finger like a woodpecker on
a dead limb. “You put in the paper—<em>here</em>. It is
lost. You find. <em>You</em> are Kenway, and you say the
so-antique bracelet shall be give to who proves
property.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“We will return it to the owner. Only to the
owner,” interrupted Agnes, backing away from
him again, for his vehemence half frightened her.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Shall I bring Queen Alma here to say it was
her property?” he cried.
</p>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113'></a>113</span></div>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“That would be better. If Queen Alma—whoever
she is—owns the bracelet we will give it to
her when she proves property.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
The little man uttered a staccato speech in a
foreign tongue. Agnes did not understand. He
spread wide his arms in a gesture of seemingly
utter despair.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“And Queen Alma!” he sputtered. “She is
dead these two—no! t’ree hundred year!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Mercy me!” gasped Agnes, backing away
from him and sitting suddenly down in one of the
straight-backed hall chairs. “Mercy me!”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114'></a>114</span><a name='chXII' id='chXII'></a>CHAPTER XII—GETTING IN DEEPER</h2>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“You see, Mees Kenway,” sputtered the
swarthy man eagerly, “I catch the paper, here.”
He rapped the <em>Post</em> again with his finger. “I
read the Engleesh—yes. I see the notice you, the
honest Kenway, have put in the paper—”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Let me tell you, sir,” said Agnes, starting up,
“<em>all</em> the Kenways are honest. I am not the only
honest person in our family I should hope!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Agnes was much annoyed. The excitable little
foreigner spread abroad his hands again and
bowed low before her.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Please! Excuse!” he said. “I admire all
your family, oh, so very much! But it is to you
who put in the paper the words here, about the
very ancient silver bracelet.” Again that woodpecker
rapping on the Lost and Found column in
the <em>Post</em>. “No?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Yes. I put the advertisement in the paper,”
acknowledged Agnes, but wishing very much that
she had not, or that Neale O’Neil was present at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115'></a>115</span>
this exciting moment to help her handle the situation.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“So! I have come for it,” cried the swarthy
man, as though the matter were quite settled.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
But Agnes’ mind began to function pretty well
again. She determined not to be “rushed.” This
strange foreigner might be perfectly honest. But
there was not a thing to prove that the bracelet
given to Tess and Dot by the Gypsy women belonged
to him.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“How do you know,” she asked, “that the
bracelet we have in our possession is the one you
have lost?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I? Oh, no, lady! I did not lose the ancient
heirloom. Oh, no.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“But you say—”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I am only its rightful owner,” he explained.
“Had Queen Alma’s bracelet been in my possession
it never would have been lost and so found
by the so—gracious Kenway. Indeed, no!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Then, what have you come here for?” cried
Agnes, in some desperation. “I cannot give the
bracelet to anybody but the one who lost it—”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“You say here the owner!” cried the man, beginning
again the woodpecker tapping on the
paper.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“But how do I know you own it?” she gasped.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116'></a>116</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Show it me. In one moment’s time can I tell—at
the one glance,” was the answer of assurance.
“Oh, yes, yes, yes!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
These “yeses” were accompanied by the emphatic
tapping on the paper. Agnes wondered
that the <em>Post</em> at that spot was not quite worn
through.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Perhaps it was fortunate that at this moment
Neale O’Neil came in. That he came direct from
the garage and apparently from a struggle with
oily machinery, both his hands and face betrayed.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Hey!” he exploded. “If we are going to take
Mr. Pinkney out on a cross-country chase after
that missing pirate this afternoon, we’ve got to
get a hustle on. You going to be ready, Aggie?
Mr. Pinkney gets home at a quarter to one.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh, Neale!” cried Agnes, turning eagerly to
greet the boy. “Talk to this man—do! I don’t
know what to say to him.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
The boy’s countenance broadened in a smile.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘Say&nbsp;&nbsp;“Hullo!”&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;“How-de-do!”<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“How’s&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;world&nbsp;&nbsp;a-using&nbsp;&nbsp;you?”’”<br />
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
quoted Neale, and chuckled outright. “What’s
his name? What does he want?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Costello—that me,” interposed the strange
junkman. He gazed curiously at Neale with his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117'></a>117</span>
snapping black eyes. “<em>You</em> are not Kenway—here
in the pape’?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Again the finger tapped upon the Lost and
Found column in the <em>Post</em>. Neale shook his head.
He glanced out of the open door and spied the
wagon and its informative sign.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“You are a junkman, are you, Mr. Costello?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Yes, yes, yes! I buy the pape’, buy the rag
and bot’—buy anytheeng I get cheap. But not to
buy do I come this time to Mees Kenway. No, no!
I come because of this in the paper.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
His tapping finger called attention again to the
advertisement of the bracelet. Neale expelled a
surprised whistle.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh, Aggie!” he said, “is he after the Gypsy
bracelet?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
The swarthy man’s face was all eagerness
again.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Yes, yes, yes!” he sputtered. “I am Gypsy.
Spanish Gypsy. Of the tribe of Costello. I am—what
you say?—direct descendent of Queen
Alma who live three hunder’—maybe more—year
ago, and she own that bracelet the honest Kenway
find!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“She—she’s dead, then? This Queen Alma?”
stammered Neale.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“<em>Si, si!</em> Yes, yes! But the so-antique bracelet
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118'></a>118</span>
descend by right to our family. That Beeg
Jeem—”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
He burst again into the language he had used
before which was quite unintelligible to either of
his listeners; but Neale thought by the man’s expression
of countenance that his opinion of “Beeg
Jeem” was scarcely to be told in polite English.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Wait!” Neale broke in. “Let’s get this
straight. We—we find a bracelet which we advertise.
You say the bracelet is yours. Where and
how did you lose it?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I already tell the honest Kenway, I do <em>not</em>
lose it.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“It was stolen from you, then?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Yes, yes, yes! It was stole. A long ago it was
stole. And now Beeg Jeem say he lose it. You
find—yes?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“This seems to be complicated,” Neale declared,
shaking his head and gazing wonderingly
at Agnes. “If you did not lose it yourself, Mr.
Costello—”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“But it is mine!” cried the man.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“We don’t know that,” said Neale, somewhat
bruskly. “You must prove it.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Prove it?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Yes. In the first place, describe the bracelet.
Tell us just how it is engraved, or ornamented, or
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119'></a>119</span>
whatever it is. How wide and thick is it? What
kind of a bracelet is it, aside from its being made
of silver?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Ah! Queen Alma’s bracelet is so well known
to the Costello—how shall I say? Yes, yes, yes!”
cried the man, with rather graceful gestures.
“And when Beeg Jeem tell me she is lost—”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“All right. Describe it,” put in Neale.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Agnes suddenly tugged at Neale’s sleeve. Her
pretty face was aflame with excitement.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh, Neale!” she interposed in a whisper.
“Even if he can describe it exactly we do not
know that he is the real owner.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Shucks! That’s right,” agreed the boy.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
He turned to Costello again demanding:
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“How can you prove that this bracelet—if it is
the one you think it is—belongs to you?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“She belong to the Costello family. It is an
heirloom. I tell it you.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“That’s all right. But you’ve got to prove it.
Even if you describe the thing that only proves
that you have seen it, or heard it described yourself.
It might be so, you know, Mr. Costello. You
must give us some evidence of ownership.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Queen Alma’s bracelet—” began Costello.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
The junkman made a despairing gesture with
wide-spread arms.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120'></a>120</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Me? How can I tell you, sir, and the honest
Kenway? It has always belong to the Costello.
Yes, yes, yes! That so-ancient bracelet, Beeg
Jeem have no right to it.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“But he was the one who lost it!” exclaimed
Neale, being quite confident now of the identity of
“Beeg Jeem.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Yes, yes, yes! So he say. I no believe. Then
I see the reading here in the pape’, of the honest
Kenway”—tap, tap, tapping once more of the
forefinger—“and I see it must be so. I—”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Hold on!” exclaimed Neale. “You did not lose
the bracelet. This other fellow did. You bring
him here and let him prove ownership.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“No, no!” raved Costello, shaking both
clenched hands above his head. “He shall not
have it. It is mine. I am <em>the</em> Costello. Queen
Alma, she give it to the great, great, great gran’mudder
of <em>my</em> great, great, great—”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Shucks!” ejaculated Neale. “Now you are
going too deep into the family records for me. I
can’t follow you. It looks to me like a case for
the courts to settle.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh, Neale!” gasped Agnes.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Why, Aggie, we’d get into hot water if we let
this fellow, or any of those other Gypsies, have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121'></a>121</span>
the bracelet offhand. If this chap wants it, he will
have to see Mr. Howbridge.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh, yes!” murmured the girl with sudden relief
in her voice. “We can tell Mr. Howbridge.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Guess we’ll have to,” agreed Neale. “We
certainly have bit off more than we can chew,
Aggie. I’ll say we have. I guess maybe we’d
have been wiser if we had told your guardian
about the old bracelet before advertising it. And
Ruth has nothing on us, at that! She did not
tell him.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“We’re likely,” concluded Neale, with a side
glance at the swarthy man, “to have a dozen
worse than this one come here to bother us.
We surely did start something when we had that
ad. printed, Aggie.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122'></a>122</span><a name='chXIII' id='chXIII'></a>CHAPTER XIII—OVER THE HILLS AND FAR AWAY</h2>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Costello, the junkman, could not be further ignored,
for at this point he began another excitable
harangue. The Queen Alma bracelet, “Beeg
Jeem,” his own sorrows, and the fact that he saw
no reason why Agnes should not immediately give
up to him the silver bracelet, were all mixed up
together in a clamor that became almost deafening.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh, what shall I do? What <em>shall</em> I do?” exclaimed
the Corner House girl.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
But Neale O’Neil was quite level-headed. Like
Agnes, at first he had for a little while been swept
off his feet by the swarthy man’s vehemence. He
regained his balance now.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“We’re not going to do anything. We won’t
even show him the bracelet,” said the boy firmly.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“But it is mine! It is the heirloom of the Costello!
I, myself, tell you so,” declared the junkman,
beating his breast now instead of the newspaper.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123'></a>123</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“All right. I believe you. Don’t yell so about
it,” said Neale, but quite calmly. “That does not
alter the fact that we cannot give the bracelet up.
That is, Miss Kenway cannot.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“But she say here—in the paper—”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh, stop it!” exclaimed the exasperated boy.
“It doesn’t say in that paper that she will hand
the thing out to anybody who comes and asks for
it. If this other fellow you have been talking
about should come here, do you suppose we would
give it up to him, just on his say so?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“No, no! It is not his. It never should have
been in the possession of his family, sir. I assure
you <em>I</em> am the Costello to whose ancestors the
great Queen Alma of our tribe delivered the
bracelet.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“All right. Let it go at that,” answered Neale.
“All the more reason why we must be careful who
gets it now. If it is honestly your bracelet you
will get it, Mr. Costello. But you will have to see
Miss Kenway’s guardian and let him decide.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Her—what you call it—does he have the
bracelet?” cried the man.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“He will have it. You go there to-morrow. I
will give you his address. To-morrow he will talk
to you. He is not in his office to-day. He is a
lawyer.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124'></a>124</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh, la, la! The law! I no like the law,” declared
Costello.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“No, I presume you Gypsies don’t,” muttered
Neale, pulling out an envelope and the stub of a
pencil with which to write the address of Mr.
Howbridge’s office. “There it is. Now, that is
the best we can do for you. Only, nobody shall
be given the bracelet until you have talked with
Mr. Howbridge.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“But, I no like! The honest Kenway say here,
in the paper—”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
As he began to tap upon the newspaper again
Neale, who was a sturdy youth, crowded him out
upon the veranda of the old Corner House.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Now, go!” advised Neale, when he heard the
click of the door latch behind him. “You’ll make
nothing by lingering here and talking. There’s
your horse starting off by himself. Better get
him.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
This roused the junk dealer’s attention. The
horse was tired of standing and was half a block
away. Costello uttered an excited yelp and darted
after his junk wagon.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Agnes let Neale inside the house again. She
was much relieved.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“There! isn’t this a mess?” she said. “I am
glad you thought of Mr. Howbridge. But I <em>do</em>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125'></a>125</span>
wish Ruth had been at home. She would have
known just what to say to that funny little man.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Humph! Maybe it would have been a good
idea if she had been here,” admitted Neale slowly.
“Ruth is awfully bossy, but things do go about
right when she is on the job.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“We’ll have to see Mr. Howbridge—”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“But that can wait until to-morrow morning,”
Neale declared. “We can’t do so this afternoon
in any case. I happen to know he is out of town.
And we have promised Mr. Pinkney to take him
on a hunt for Sammy.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“All right. It is almost noon. You’d better
go and wash your face, Neale,” and she began to
giggle at him.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Don’t I know that? I came in here just to
remind you to begin to prink before dinner or
you’d never be ready.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
She was already halfway up the stairs and
she leaned over the balustrade to make a gamin’s
face at him.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Just you tend to your own apple cart, Neale
O’Neil!” she told him. “I will be ready as soon
as you are.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
At dinner, which was eaten in the middle of the
day at this time of year at the old Corner House,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126'></a>126</span>
Agnes appeared ready all but her hat for the car.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh, Aggie! can we go too?” cried Dot. “We
want to ride in the automobile, don’t we, Tess?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“We maybe want to go riding,” confessed the
other sister slowly. “But I guess we can’t, Dot.
You forget that Margie and Holly Pease are coming
over at three o’clock. They haven’t seen the
fretted silver bracelet.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“That reminds me,” said Agnes firmly. “You
must not take that bracelet out of the house. Understand?
Not at all.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Why, Aggie!” murmured Tess, while Dot
grew quite red with indignation.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“If you wish to play with it indoors, all right,”
Agnes said. “Whose turn to have it, is it to-day?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Mine,” admitted Tess.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Then I hold you responsible. Not out of the
house. We have got to get Mr. Howbridge’s advice
about it, in any case.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Ruth didn’t say we couldn’t wear the bracelet
out-of-doors,” declared Dot, pouting.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I am in Ruth’s place,” responded the older
sister promptly. “Now, remember! You might
lose it anyway. And <em>then</em> what would we do if
the owner really comes for it?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127'></a>127</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“But they won’t!” cried Dot, confidently.
“Those Gypsy ladies gave it to us for keeps. I am
sure.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“You certainly would not wish to keep the
bracelet if the person the Gypsies stole it from
came here to get it?” said Agnes sternly.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh—oo! No-o,” murmured Dot.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Of course we would not, Sister,” Tess declared
briskly. “If we knew just where their
camp is we would take it to them anyway. Of
course we would, Dot!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh, of course,” agreed Dot, but very faintly.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“You children are so seldom observant,” went
on Agnes in her most grown-up manner. “You
should have looked into that basket when you
bought it of the Gypsies. Then you would have
seen the bracelet before the women got away.
You are almost <em>never</em> observant.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Why, Aggie!” Tess exclaimed, rather hurt by
the accusation of her older sister. “That is what
your Mr. Marks said when he came into our grade
at school just before the end of term last June.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Mr. Curtis G. Marks was the principal of the
High School which Agnes attended.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“What was Mr. Marks doing over in your
room, Tess?” Agnes asked curiously.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Visiting. Our teacher asked him to ‘take the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128'></a>128</span>
class.’ You know, visiting teachers always <em>are</em> so
nosey,” added Tess with more frankness than
good taste.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Better not let Ruth hear you use that expression,
child,” laughed Agnes. “But what about
being observant—or <em>un</em>observant?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“He told us,” Tess went on to say, “to watch
closely, and then asked for somebody to give him
a number. So somebody said thirty-two.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Yes?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“And Mr. Marks went to the board and wrote
twenty-three on it. Of course, none of us said
anything. Then Mr. Marks asked for another
number and somebody gave him ninety-four.
Then he wrote forty-nine on the board, and nobody
said a word.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Why didn’t you?” asked Agnes in wonder.
“Did you think he was teaching you some new
game?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I—I guess we were too polite. You see, he
was a visitor. And he said right out loud to our
teacher: ‘You see, they do not observe. Is it
dense stupidity, or just inattention?’ That’s <em>just</em>
what he said,” added Tess, her eyes flashing.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh!” murmured Dot. “Didn’t he know how
to write the number right?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“So,” continued Tess, “I guess we all felt sort
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129'></a>129</span>
of hurt. And Belle Littleweed got so fidgety that
she raised her hand. Mr. Marks says: ‘Very well,
you give me a number.’
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Belle lisps a little, you know, Aggie, and she
said right out: ‘Theventy-theven; thee if you can
turn that around!’ He didn’t think we noticed
anything, and were stupid; but I guess he knows
better now,” added Tess with satisfaction.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“That is all right,” said Agnes with a sigh.
“I heartily wish you and Dot had been observant
when those women gave you the basket and you
had found the bracelet in it before they got away.
It is going to make us trouble I am afraid.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Agnes told the little ones nothing about the
strange junkman and his claim. Nor did she mention
the affair to any of the remainder of the
Corner House family. She only added:
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“So don’t you take the bracelet out of the house
or let anybody at all have it—if Neale or I are
not here.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Why, it would not be right to give the bracelet
to anybody but the Gypsy ladies, would it?” said
Tess.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Of course not,” agreed Dot. “And <em>they</em>
haven’t come after it.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Agnes did not notice these final comments of
the two smaller girls. She had given them instructions,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130'></a>130</span>
and those instructions were sufficient,
she thought, to avert any trouble regarding the
mysterious bracelet—whether it was “Queen
Alma’s” or not.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
The junkman, Costello, certainly had filled Agnes’
mind with most romantic imaginations! If
the old silver bracelet was a Gypsy heirloom and
had been handed down through the Costello tribe—as
the junkman claimed—for three hundred
years and more, of course it would not be considered
stolen property.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
The mystery remained why the Gypsy women
had left the bracelet in the basket they had almost
forced upon the Kenway children. The explanation
of this was quite beyond Agnes, unless it had
been done because the Gypsy women feared that
this very Costello was about to claim the heirloom,
and they considered it safer with Tess and Dot
than in their own possession. True, this seemed
a far-fetched explanation of the affair; yet what
so probable?
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
The Gypsies might be quite familiar with Milton,
and probably knew a good deal about the old
Corner House and the family now occupying it.
The little girls would of course be honest. The
Gypsies were shrewd people. They were quite
sure, no doubt, that the Kenways would not give
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131'></a>131</span>
the bracelet to any person but the women who sold
the basket, unless the right to the property could
be proved.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“And even if that Costello man does own the
bracelet, how is he going to prove it?” Agnes
asked Neale, as they ran the car out of the garage
after dinner. “I guess we are going to hand dear
old Mr. Howbridge a big handful of trouble.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Crickey! isn’t that a fact?” grumbled Neale.
“The more I think of it, the sorrier I am we put
that advertisement in the paper, Aggie.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
There was nothing more to be said about that
at the time, for Mr. Pinkney was already waiting
for them on his front steps. His wife was at the
door and she looked so weary-eyed and pale of
face that Agnes at least felt much sympathy for
her.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh, don’t worry, Mrs. Pinkney!” cried the
girl from her seat beside Neale. “I am sure
Sammy will turn up all right. Neale says so—everybody
says so! He is such a plucky boy, anyway.
Nothing would happen to him.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“But this seems worse than any other time,”
said the poor woman. “He must have never
meant to come back, or he would not have taken
that picture with him.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Nonsense!” exclaimed her husband cheerfully. “Sammy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132'></a>132</span>
sort of fancied himself in that
picture, that is all. He is not without his share
of vanity.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“That is what <em>you</em> say,” complained Sammy’s
mother. “But I just feel that something dreadful
has happened to him this time.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Never mind,” called Neale, starting the engine,
“we’ll go over the hills and far away, but
we’ll find some trace of him, Mrs. Pinkney.
Sammy can’t have hidden himself so completely
that we cannot discover where he has been and
where he is going.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
That is exactly what they did. They flew about
the environs of Milton in a rapid search for the
truant. Wherever they stopped and made inquiries
for the first hour or so, however, they
gained no word of Sammy.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
It was three o’clock, and they were down
toward the canal on the road leading to Hampton
Mills, when they gained the first possible clue of
the missing one. And that clue was more than
twenty-four hours old.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
A storekeeper remembered a boy who answered
to Sammy’s description buying something to eat
the day before, and sitting down on the store step
to eat it. That boy carried a heavy extension-bag
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133'></a>133</span>
and went on after he had eaten along the
Hampton Mills road.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“We’ve struck his trail!” declared Neale
with satisfaction. “Don’t you think so, Mr.
Pinkney?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“How did he pay you for the things he
bought?” asked the father of the runaway, addressing
the storekeeper again. “What kind of
money did he have?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“He had ten cent pieces, I remember. And he
had them tied in a handkerchief. Nicked his bank
before he started, did he?” and the man laughed.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“That is exactly what he did,” admitted Mr.
Pinkney, returning hurriedly to the car. “Drive
on, Neale. I guess we are on the right trail.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134'></a>134</span><a name='chXIV' id='chXIV'></a>CHAPTER XIV—ALMOST HAD HIM</h2>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Neale drove almost recklessly for the first few
miles after passing the roadside store; but the
eyes of all three people in the car were very wide
open and their minds observant. Anything or
anybody that might give trace of the truant
Sammy were scrutinized.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“He was at that store before noon,” Agnes
shouted into Neale’s ear. “How long before he
would be hungry again?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“No knowing. Pretty soon, of course,” admitted
her chum. “But I heard that storekeeper
tell Mr. Pinkney that the boy bought more than
he could eat at once and he carried the rest away
in a paper bag.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“That is so,” admitted Mr. Pinkney, leaning
over the forward seat. “But he has an appetite
like a boa constrictor.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“A <em>boy</em>-constrictor,” chuckled Neale. “I’ll say
he has!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“He would not likely stop anywhere along here
to buy more food, then,” Agnes said.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135'></a>135</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“He could have gone off the road, however, for
a dozen different things,” said the missing boy’s
father. “That child has got more crotchets in his
head than you can shake a stick at. There is no
knowing—”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Hold on!” ejaculated Neale suddenly. “There
are some kids down there by that pond. Suppose
I run down and interview them?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I don’t see anybody among them who looks
like Sammy,” observed Agnes, standing up in the
car to look.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Never mind. You go ahead, Neale. They
will talk to you more freely, perhaps, than they
will to me. Boys are that way.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I’ll try,” said Neale, and jumped out of the
car and ran down toward the roof of the old ice-house
that the afternoon before had so attracted
Sammy Pinkney—incidentally wrecking his best
trousers.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
As it chanced, Neale had seen and now interviewed
the very party of boys with whom Sammy
had previously made friends. But Neale said
nothing at first to warn these boys that he was
searching for one whom they all considered “a
good kid.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Say, fellows,” Neale began, “was this an ice-house
before it got burned down?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136'></a>136</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Yep,” replied the bigger boy of the group.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“And only the roof left? Crickey! What have
you chaps been doing? Sliding down it?” For
he had observed as he came down from the car two
of the smaller boys doing just that.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“It’s great fun,” said the bigger boy, grinning,
perhaps at the memory of what had happened to
Sammy Pinkney’s trousers the previous afternoon.
“Want to try?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Neale grinned more broadly, and gave the shingled
roof another glance. “I bet <em>you</em> don’t slide
down it like those little fellows I just saw doing
it. How do their pants stand it?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
The boys giggled at that.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Say!” the bigger one said, “there was a kid
came along yesterday that didn’t get on to that—<em>till
afterward</em>.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh, ho!” chuckled Neale. “He wore ’em
right through, did he?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Yes, he did. And then he was sore. Said his
mother would give him fits.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Where does he live? Around here?” asked
Neale carelessly.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I never saw him before,” admitted the bigger
boy. “He was a good fellow just the same. You
looking for him?” he asked with sudden suspicion.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137'></a>137</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I don’t know. If he’s the boy I mean he
needn’t be afraid to go home because of his torn
pants. You tell him so if you see him again.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Sure. I didn’t know he was running away.
He didn’t say anything.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Didn’t he have a bag with him—sort of a suitcase?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Didn’t see it,” replied the boy. “We all went
home to supper and he went his way.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Which way?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Could not tell you that,” the other said reflectively,
and was evidently honest about it. “He
was coming from that way,” and he pointed back
toward Milton, “when he joined us here at the
slide.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Then he probably kept on toward—What is
in that direction?” and Neale pointed at the nearest
road, the very one into which Sammy had
turned.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh, that goes up through the woods,” said the
boy. “Hampton Mills is over around the pond—you
follow yonder road.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Yes, I know. But you think this fellow you
speak of might have gone into that by road?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“He was headed that way when we first saw
him,” said the boy. “Wasn’t he, Jimmy?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Sure,” agreed the smaller boy addressed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138'></a>138</span>
“And, Tony, I bet he <em>did</em> go that way. When I
looked back afterward I remember I saw a boy
lugging something heavy going up that road.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I didn’t see that that fellow had a bag,” argued
the bigger boy. “But he might have hid
it when he came down here.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Likely he did,” admitted Neale. “Anyway,
we will go up that road through the woods and
see.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“<em>Is</em> his mother going to give him fits for those
torn pants?” asked another of the group.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“She’ll be so glad to see him home again,” confessed
Neale, “that he could tear every pair of
pants he’s got and she wouldn’t say a word!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
He made his way up the bank to the car and
reported.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I don’t know where that woods-road leads to.
I neglected to bring a map. But it looks as though
we could get through it with the car. We’ll try,
sha’n’t we?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh, do, Neale,” urged Agnes.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I guess it is as good a lead as any,” observed
Mr. Pinkney. “Somehow, I begin to feel as
though the boy had got a good way off this time.
Even this clue is almost twenty-four hours
old.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“He must have stayed somewhere last night,”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139'></a>139</span>
cried Agnes suddenly. “If there is a house up
there in the woods—or beyond—we can ask.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Right you are, Aggie,” agreed Neale, starting
the car again.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Sammy Pinkney is an elusive youngster, sure
enough,” said the truant’s father. “Something
has got to stop him from running away. It costs
too much time and money to overtake him and
bring him back.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“And we haven’t done that yet,” murmured
Agnes.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
The car struck heavy going in the road through
the woods before they had gone very far up the
rise. In places the road was soft and had been
cut up by the wheels of heavy trucks or wagons.
And they did not pass a single house—not even a
cleared spot in the wood—on either hand.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“If he started up this way so near supper time
last evening, as those boys say,” Mr. Pinkney
ruminated, “where was he at supper time?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Here, or hereabout, I should say!” exclaimed
Neale O’Neil. “Why, it must have been pretty
dark when he got this far.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“If he really came this far,” added Agnes.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Well, let us run along and see if there is a
house anywhere,” Mr. Pinkney said. “Of course,
Sammy might have slept out—”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140'></a>140</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“It wouldn’t be the first time, I bet!” chuckled
Neale.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“And of course there would be nothing to hurt
him in these woods?” suggested Agnes.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Nothing bigger than a rabbit, I guess,” agreed
their neighbor.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Well—”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Neale increased the speed of the car again,
turned a blind corner, and struck a soft place in
the road before he could stop. Having no skidding
chains on the rear wheels of course, the car
was out of control in an instant. It slued around.
Agnes screamed. Mr. Pinkney shouted his alarm.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
The car slid over the bank of the ditch beside
the road and both right wheels sank in mud and
water to the hubs.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Some pretty mess—I’ll tell the world!”
groaned Neale O’Neil, shutting off the engine,
while Agnes clung to his arm grimly to keep from
sliding out into the ditch, too.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Now, you <em>have</em> done it!” shrilled the girl.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Thanks. Many thanks. I expected you to say
that, Aggie,” he replied.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“M-mm! Well, I don’t suppose you meant
to—”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“No use worrying about how it was done or who
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141'></a>141</span>
did it,” interposed Mr. Pinkney, briskly getting
out of the tonneau on the left side. “The question
is, how are we going to right the car and get
under way again?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“A truer word was never spoken,” agreed
Neale O’Neil. “Come on, Agnes. We’ll creep out
on this side, too. That’s it. Looks to me, Mr.
Pinkney, as though we should need a couple of
good, strong levers to pry up the wheels. You
and I can do that while Agnes gets in under the
wheel and manipulates the mechanism, as it
were.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“You are the boss, here, Neale,” said the older
man, immediately entering the wood on the right
side of the road. “I see a stick here that looks
promising.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
He passed under the broadly spreading
branches of a huge chestnut tree. There were
several of these monsters along the edge of the
wood. Mr. Pinkney suddenly shouted something,
and dropped upon his knees between two outcropping
roots of the tree.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“What is it, Mr. Pinkney?” cried Agnes, running
across the road.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Their neighbor appeared, erect again. In his
hand he bore the well-remembered extension-bag
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142'></a>142</span>
which Sammy Pinkney had so often borne away
from home upon his truant escapades.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“What do you know about this?” demanded
Sammy’s father. “Here’s his bag—filled with his
possessions, by the feel of it. But where is the
boy?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“He—he’s got away!” gasped Agnes.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“And we almost had him,” was Neale’s
addition to the amazed remarks of the trio of
searchers.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143'></a>143</span><a name='chXV' id='chXV'></a>CHAPTER XV—UNCERTAINTIES</h2>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
The secret had now been revealed! But of
course it did not do Sammy Pinkney the least bit
of good. His extension-bag had not been stolen
at all.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Merely, when that sleepy boy had stumbled
away the night before to the spring for a drink of
water, he had not returned to the right tree for
the remainder of the night. In his excitement in
the morning, after discovering his loss, Sammy
ran about a good deal (as Uncle Rufus would
have said) “like a chicken wid de haid cut off.”
He did not manage to find the right tree at all.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
The extension-bag was now in his father’s
hands. Mr. Pinkney brought it to the mired car
and opened it. There was no mistaking the contents
of the bag for anything but Sammy’s possessions.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“What do you know about that?” murmured
the amazed father of the embryo pirate. He rummaged
through the conglomeration of chattels in
the bag. “No, it is not here.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144'></a>144</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“What are you looking for, Mr. Pinkney?”
demanded Agnes, feeling rather serious herself.
Something might have happened to the truant.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“That picture his mother spoke of,” the father
answered, with a sigh.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Hoh!” exclaimed Neale O’Neil, “if the kid
thinks as much of it as Mrs. Pinkney says, he’s
got it with him. Of course.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“It looks so,” admitted Mr. Pinkney. “But
why should he abandon his clothes—and all?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh, maybe he hasn’t!” cried Agnes eagerly.
“Maybe he is coming back here.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“You think this old tree,” said Mr. Pinkney in
doubt, “is Sammy’s headquarters?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I—don’t—know—”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“That wouldn’t be like Sammy,” declared
Neale, with conviction. “He always keeps moving—even
when he is stowaway on a canalboat,”
and he chuckled at the memory of that incident.
“For some reason he was chased away from here.
Or,” hitting the exact truth without knowing it,
“he tucked the bag under that tree root and forgot
where he put it.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Does that sound reasonable?” gasped Agnes.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Quite reasonable—for Sammy,” grumbled
Mr. Pinkney. “He is just so scatter-brained. But
what shall I tell his mother when I take this bag
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145'></a>145</span>
home to her? She will feel worse than she has
before.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Maybe we will find him yet,” Agnes interposed.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“That’s what we are out for,” Neale added
with confidence. “Let’s not give up hope. Why,
we’re finding clues all the time.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“And now you manage to get us stuck in the
mud,” put in Agnes, giving her boy friend rather
an unfair dig.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Have a heart! How could I help it? Anyway,
we’ll get out all right. We sha’n’t have to
camp here all night, if Sammy did.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“That is it,” interposed Sammy’s father. “I
wonder if he stayed here all night or if he abandoned
the bag here and kept on. Maybe the woods
were too much for his nerves,” and he laughed
rather uncertainly.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I bet Sammy was not scared,” announced
Neale, with confidence. “He is a courageous
chap. If he wasn’t, he would not start out alone
this way.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“True enough,” said Mr. Pinkney, not without
some pride. “But nevertheless it would help
some if we were sure he was here only twelve
hours ago, instead of twenty-four.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Let’s get the car out of the ditch and see if we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146'></a>146</span>
can go on,” Neale suggested. “I’ll get that pole
you saw, Mr. Pinkney. And I see another lever
over there.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
While Mr. Pinkney buckled the straps of the
extension-bag again and stowed the bag under
the seat, Neale brought the two sticks of small
timber which he thought would be strong enough
to lift the wheels of the stalled car out of the ditch.
But first he used the butt of one of the sticks to
knock down the edge of the bank in front of each
wheel.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“You see,” he said to Agnes, “when you get
it started you want to turn the front wheels, if
you can, to the left and climb right out on to the
road. Mr. Pinkney and I will do the best we can
for you; but it is the power of the engine that
must get us out of the ditch.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I—I don’t know that I can handle it right,
Neale,” hesitated Agnes.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Sure you can. You’ve got to!” he told her.
“Come on, Mr. Pinkney! Let’s see if we can get
these sticks under the wheels on this side.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Wait a moment,” urged the man, who was
writing hastily on a page torn from his notebook.
“I must leave a note for Sammy—if perhaps he
should come back here looking for his bag.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147'></a>147</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Better not say anything about his torn trousers,
Mr. Pinkney,” giggled Agnes. “He will shy
at that.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“He can tear all his clothes to pieces if he’ll
only come home and stop his mother’s worrying.
Only, the little rascal ought to be soundly
trounced just the same for all the trouble he is
causing us.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“If only I had stayed with him at that beet bed
and made sure he knew what he was doing,”
sighed Agnes, who felt somewhat condemned.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“It would have been something else that sent
him off in this way, if it hadn’t been beets,” grumbled
Mr. Pinkney. “He was about due for a
break-away. I should have paid more attention
to him myself. But business was confining.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh, well; we always see our mistakes when
it is too late. But that boy needs somebody’s
oversight besides his mother’s. She is always
afraid I will be too harsh with him. But she
doesn’t manage him, that is sure.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“We’d better catch the rabbit before we make
the rabbit stew,” chuckled Neale O’Neil. “Sammy
is a good kid, I tell you. Only he has crazy
notions.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Pooh!” put in Agnes. “You need not talk in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148'></a>148</span>
so old-fashioned a way. You used to have somewhat
similar ‘crazy notions’ yourself. You ran
away a couple of times.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Well, did I have a real home and a mother and
father to run from?” demanded the boy. “Guess
not!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“You’ve got a father now,” laughed Agnes.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“But he isn’t like a real father,” sighed Neale.
“He has run away from me! I know it is necessary
for him to go back to Alaska to attend to
that mine. But I’ll be glad when he comes home
for good—or I can go to him.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh, Neale! You wouldn’t?” gasped the girl.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Wouldn’t what?” he asked, surprised by her
vehemence.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Go away up to Alaska?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I’d like to,” admitted the boy. “Wouldn’t
you?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh—well—if you can take me along,” rejoined
Agnes with satisfaction, “all right. But
under no other circumstances can you go, Neale
O’Neil.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149'></a>149</span><a name='chXVI' id='chXVI'></a>CHAPTER XVI—THE DEAD END OF NOWHERE</h2>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Mr. Pinkney and Neale went to work to hoist
the motor-car into the road again. No easy nor
brief struggle was this. A dozen times Agnes
started the car and the wheels slipped off the poles
or Neale or Mr. Pinkney lost his grip.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Before long they were well bespattered with
mud (for there was considerable water in the
ditch) and so was the automobile. Neale and
their neighbor worked to the utmost of their muscular
strength, and Agnes was in tears.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Pluck up your courage, Aggie,” panted her
boy friend. “We’ll get it yet.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I just feel that it is my fault,” sobbed the girl.
“All this slipping and sliding. If I could only
just get it to start right—”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Again!” cried Neale cheerfully.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
And this time the forewheels really got on solid
ground. Mr. Pinkney thrust his lever in behind
the sloughed hind wheel and blocked it from sliding
back.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Great!” yelled Neale. “Once more, Aggie!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150'></a>150</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
She obeyed his order, and although the automobile
engine rattled a good deal and the car itself
plunged like a bucking broncho, they finally got all
the wheels out of the mud and on the firm road.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Crickey!” gasped Neale. “It looks like a
battlefield.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“And we look as though we had been in the
battle all right,” said Mr. Pinkney. “Guess
Mamma Pinkney will have something to say
about <em>my</em> trousers when we get home, let alone
Sammy’s.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Do you suppose the car will run all right?”
asked the anxious Agnes. “I don’t know what
Ruth would say if we broke down.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“She’d say a-plenty,” returned Neale. “But
wait till I get some of this mud off me and I’ll try
her out again. By the way she bucked that last
time I should say there was nothing much the
matter with her machinery.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
This proved to be true. If anything was
strained about the mechanism it did not immediately
show up. Neale got the automobile under
way without any difficulty and they drove ahead
through the now fast darkening road.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
The belt of woods was not very wide, but the
car ran slowly and when the searchers came out
upon the far side, the old shack which housed the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151'></a>151</span>
big, red-faced woman, who had been kind to
Sammy, and her brood of children, some of whom
had been not at all kind, the place looked to be
deserted.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
In truth, the family were berry pickers and had
been gone all day (after Sammy’s adventure with
the cherry-colored calf) up in the hills after berries.
They had not yet returned for the evening
meal, and although Neale stopped the car in front
of the shack Mr. Pinkney decided Sammy would
not have remained at the abandoned place.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
And, of course, Sammy had not remained here.
After his exciting fight with Peter and Liz, and
fearing to return to the house to complain, he had
gone right on. Where he had gone was another
matter. The automobile party drove to the town
of Crimbleton, which was the next hamlet, and
there Mr. Pinkney made exhaustive inquiries regarding
his lost boy, but to no good result.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“We’ll try again to-morrow, Mr. Pinkney, if
you say so,” urged Neale.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Of course we will,” agreed Agnes. “We’ll
go every day until you find him.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Their neighbor shook his head with some sadness.
“I am afraid it will do no good. Sammy
has given us the slip this time. Perhaps I would
better put the matter in the hands of a detective
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152'></a>152</span>
agency. For myself, I should be contented to
wait until he shows up of his own volition. But
his mother—”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Agnes and Neale saw, however, that the man
was himself very desirous of getting hold of his
boy again. They made a hasty supper at the
Crimbleton Inn and then started homeward at a
good rate of speed.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
When they came up the grade toward the old
house beside the road, at the edge of the wood, the
big woman and her family had returned, made
their own supper, and gone to bed. The place
looked just as deserted as before.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“The dead-end of nowhere,” Neale called it,
and the automobile gathered speed as it went by.
So the searchers missed making inquiry at the
very spot where inquiry might have done the most
good. The trail of Sammy Pinkney was lost.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Neale O’Neil wanted to satisfy himself about
one thing. He said nothing to Agnes about it, but
after he had put up the car and locked the garage,
he walked down Main Street to Byburg’s candy
store.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
June Wildwood was always there until half
past nine, and Saturday nights until later. She
was at her post behind the sweets counter on this
occasion when Neale entered.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153'></a>153</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I am glad to see you, Neale,” she said. “I’m
awfully curious.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“About that bracelet?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Yes,” she admitted. “What has come of it?
Anything?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Enough. Tell me,” began Neale, before she
could put in any further question, “while you
were with the Gypsies did you hear anything
about Queen Alma?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Queen Zaliska. I was Queen Zaliska. They
dressed me up and stained my face to look the
part.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh, I know all about that,” Neale returned.
“But this Queen Alma was some ancient lady.
She lived three hundred years ago.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Goodness! How you talk, Neale O’Neil. Of
course I don’t know anything about such a
person.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Those Gypsies you were with never talked of
her?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I didn’t hear them. I never learned much of
the language they use among themselves.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Well, we got a tip,” said the boy, “that the
bracelet belonged to this Queen Alma, and that
there is a row among the Gypsies over the ownership
of it.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“You don’t tell me!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154'></a>154</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I am telling you. We heard so. Say, is that
Big Jim a Spaniard? A Spanish Gypsy, I mean?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I don’t know. Maybe. He looks like a Spaniard,
or a Mexican, or an Italian.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Yes. I thought he did. He comes of some
Latin race, anyway. What is his last name?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Why—I—I am not sure that I know.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Is it Costello? Did you hear that name while
you were with the Gypsies, June?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Some of them are named Costello. It is a
family name among them I guess. And about that
Jim. Do you know that I saw him yesterday
driving down Main Street in an automobile?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“You don’t mean it? Gypsies are going to become
flivver traders instead of horse swappers,
are they?” and Neale laughed.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh, it was a big, seven-passenger car,” said
June. “Those Gypsies have money, if they want
to spend it.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Did you ever hear of a Gypsy junkman?”
chuckled Neale.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Of course not. Although I guess junkmen
make good money nowadays,” drawled June
Wildwood, laughing too. “You are a funny boy,
Neale O’Neil. Do you want to know anything
else?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Lots of things. But I guess you cannot tell
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155'></a>155</span>
me much more about the Gypsies that would be
pertinent to the bracelet business. We hear that
the Costello Gypsies are fighting over the possession
of the heirloom—the bracelet, you know.
That is why one bunch of them wanted to get it off
their hands for a while—and so gave it into the
keeping of Tess and Dot.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Mercy!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Does that seem improbable to you, June?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“No-o. Not much. They might. It makes me
think that maybe the Gypsies have been watching
the old Corner House and know all about the
Kenways.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“They might easily do that. You know, they
might know us all from that time away back when
we brought you home from Pleasant Cove with us.
This is some of the same tribe you were with—sure
enough!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I know it,” sighed June Wildwood. “I’ve
been scared a little about them too. But for my
own sake. I haven’t dared tell Rosa; but pap
comes down here to the store for me every evening
and beaus me home. I feel safer.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“The bracelet business has nothing to do with
you, of course?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Of course not. But those Gypsies might have
some evil intent about Ruth and her sisters.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156'></a>156</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Guess they are just trying to use them for a
convenience. While that bracelet is in the Corner
House no other claimant but those Gypsy women
are likely to get hold of it. Believe me, it is a
puzzle,” he concluded. “I guess we will have to
put it up to Mr. Howbridge, sure enough.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh! The Kenways’s lawyer?” cried June.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Their guardian. Sure enough. That is what
we will have to do.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
But when Neale and Agnes Kenway, after an
early breakfast, hurried downtown to Mr. Howbridge’s
office the next morning to tell the lawyer
all about the Gypsies and Queen Alma’s bracelet,
they made a surprising discovery.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Mr. Howbridge had left town the evening before
on important business. He might not return
for a week.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157'></a>157</span><a name='chXVII' id='chXVII'></a>CHAPTER XVII—RUTH BEGINS TO WORRY</h2>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Oakhurst, in the mountains, was a very lovely
spot. Besides the hotel where Luke Shepard had
worked and where he had met with his accident,
there were bungalows and several old-fashioned
farmhouses where boarders were received. There
was a lake, fine golf links, bridlepaths through
the woods, and mountains to climb. It was a popular
if quiet resort.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Ruth and Cecile Shepard had rooms in one of
the farmhouses, for the hotel was expensive. Besides,
the farmer owned a beautifully shaded lawn
overlooking the lake and the girls could sit there
under the trees while the invalid, as they insisted
upon calling Luke, reclined on a swinging cot.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Believe me!” Cecile often insisted, “I will
never send another telegram as long as I live. I
cannot forgive myself for making such a mess of
it. But then, if I hadn’t done so, you would not
be here now, Ruthie.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Isn’t that a fact?” agreed her brother. “You
are all right, Sis! I am for you, strong.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158'></a>158</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Ruth laughed. Yet there were worried lines between
her eyes.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“It is all right,” she murmured. “I might have
come in any case—for Mr. Howbridge advised it
by this letter that they remailed to me. But I
should not have left in such haste, and I should
have left somebody besides Mrs. McCall to look
after the girls.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Pooh!” ejaculated Luke. “What is the matter
with Agnes?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“That is just it,” laughed Ruth again, but
shaking her head too. “It is Agnes, and what she
may do, that troubles me more than anything else.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Goodness me! She is a big girl,” declared
Cecile. “And she has lots of sense.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“She usually succeeds in hiding her good sense,
then,” rejoined Ruth. “Of course she can take
care of herself. But will she give sufficient attention
to the little ones. That is the doubt that
troubles me.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Well, you just can’t go away now!” wailed
Cecile. “You have got to stay till the doctor says
we can move Luke. I can’t take him back alone.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Now, don’t make me out so badly off. I am
lying here like a poor log because that sawbones
and you girls make me. But I know I could get
up and play baseball.”
</p>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159'></a>159</span></div>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Don’t you dare!” cried his sister.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“You would not be so unwise,” said Ruth
promptly.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“All right. Then you stop worrying, Ruth,”
the young fellow said. “Otherwise I shall ‘take
up my bed and walk’—you see! This lying around
like an ossified man is a nuisance, and it’s absurd,
anyway.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Ruth had immediately written to Mr. Howbridge
asking him to look closely after family affairs
at the Corner House. Had she known the
lawyer was not at home when her letter arrived
in Milton she certainly would have started back
by the very next train.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
She wrote Mrs. McCall, too, for exact news.
And naturally she poured into her letter to Agnes
all the questions and advice of which she could
think.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Agnes was too busy when that letter arrived to
answer it at all. Things were happening at the
old Corner House at that time of which Ruth had
never dreamed.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Ruth was really glad to be with Cecile and
Luke in the mountains. And she tried to throw
off her anxiety.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Luke insisted that his sister and Ruth should
go over to the hotel to dance in the evening when
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160'></a>160</span>
he had to go to bed, as the doctor ordered. He
had become acquainted with most of the hotel
guests before his injury, and the young people
liked Luke Shepard.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
They welcomed his sister and Ruth as one of
themselves, and the two girls had the finest kind
of a time. At least, Cecile did, and she said that
Ruth might have had, had she not been thinking
of the home-folk so much.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Several days passed, and although Ruth heard
nothing from home save a brief and hurried note
from Agnes, telling of their unsuccessful search
for Sammy—and nothing much else—the older
Kenway girl began to feel that her anxiety had
been unnecessary.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Then came Mrs. McCall’s labored letter. The
old Scotchwoman was never an easy writer. And
her thoughts did not run to the way of clothing
facts in readable English. She was plain and
blunt. At least a part of her letter immediately
made Ruth feel that she was needed at home, and
that even her interest in Luke Shepard should
not detain her longer at Oakhurst.
</p>

<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“We have got to have another watchdog. Old
Tom Jonah is too old; it is my opinion. I mind he
is getting deaf, or something, or he wouldn’t have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161'></a>161</span>
let that man come every night and stare in at the
window. Faith, he is a nuisance—the man, I
mean, Ruth, not the old dog.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I have spoke to the police officer on the beat;
but Mr. Howbridge being out of town I don’t know
what else to do about that man. And such a foxy
looking man as he is!
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Neale O’Neil, who is a good lad, I’m saying,
and no worse than other boys of his age for sure,
offers to watch by night. But I have not allowed
it. He and Aggie talk of Gypsies, and they show
me that silver bracelet—a bit barbarous thing that
you remember the children had to play with—and
say the dark man who comes to the window nights
is a Gypsy. I think he is a plain tramp, that is
all, my lass.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Don’t let these few lines worry you. Linda
goes to bed with the stove poker every night, and
Uncle Rufus says he has oiled up your great
uncle’s old shotgun. But I know that gun has no
hammer to it, so I am not afraid of the weapon
at all. I just want to make that black-faced man
go away from the house and mind his own business.
It is a nuisance he is.”
</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I must go home—oh, I must!” Ruth said to
Cecile as soon as she had read this effusion from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162'></a>162</span>
the old housekeeper. “Just think! A man spying
on them—and a Gypsy!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Pooh! it can’t be anything of importance,”
scoffed Cecile.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“It must be. Think! I told you about the
Gypsy bracelet. There must be more of importance
connected with that than we thought.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
She had already told Luke and Cecile about the
mystery of the silver ornament.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Why, I thought you had told Mr. Howbridge
about it,” Cecile said.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I did not. I really forgot to when the news
of Luke’s illness came,” and Ruth blushed.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“That quite drove everything else out of your
head, did it?” laughed the other girl. “But now
why let it bother you? Of course Mr. Howbridge
will attend to things—”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“But he seems to be away,” murmured Ruth.
“Evidently Mrs. McCall and Agnes have not been
able to reach him. Oh, Cecile! I must really go
home.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Then you will have to come back,” declared
Cecile Shepard. “I could not possibly travel with
Luke alone.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
The physician had confided more to the girls
than to Luke himself about the young man’s physical
condition. The medical man feared some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163'></a>163</span>
spinal trouble if Luke did not remain quiet and lie
flat on his back for some time to come.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
But the day following Ruth’s receipt of Mrs.
McCall’s anxiety-breeding letter, Dr. Moline
agreed to the young man’s removal.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“But only in a compartment. You must take
the afternoon train on which you can engage a
compartment. He must lie at ease all the way. I
will take him to the station in my car. And have
a car to meet him when you get to the Milton
station.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
The first of these instructions Ruth was able to
follow faithfully. The cost of such a trip was not
to be considered. She would not even allow Luke
and Cecile to speak about it.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Ruth had her own private bank account, arranged
for and supervised, it was true, by Mr.
Howbridge, and she prided herself upon doing
business in a businesslike way.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Just before they boarded the train at Oakhurst
station she telegraphed home that they were coming
and for Neale to meet them with the car, late
though their arrival would be. If on time, the
train would stop at Milton just after midnight.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
When that telegram arrived at the old Corner
House it failed to make much of a disturbance in
the pool of the household existence. And for a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164'></a>164</span>
very good reason. So much had happened there
during the previous few hours that the advent of
the King and Queen of England (and this Mrs.
McCall herself said) would have created a very
small “hooroo.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
As for Neale O’Neil’s getting out the car and
going down to the station to meet Ruth and her
friends when they arrived, that seemed to be quite
impossible. The coming of the telegram was at an
hour when already the Kenway automobile was
far away from Milton, and Neale and Agnes in it
were having high adventure.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165'></a>165</span><a name='chXVIII' id='chXVIII'></a>CHAPTER XVIII—THE JUNKMAN AGAIN</h2>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
When Ruth started home with Luke and Cecile
Shepard several days had elapsed since Neale
O’Neil and Agnes had discovered that Mr. Howbridge
was out of town.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
The chief clerk at the lawyer’s office had little
time to give to the youthful visitors, for just then
he had his hands full with a caller whom Neale
and Agnes had previously found was a person not
easily to be pacified.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“There is a crazy man in here,” grumbled the
clerk. “I don’t know what he means. He says he
‘comes from Kenway,’ and there is something
about Queen Alma and her bracelet. What do you
know about this, Miss Kenway?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh, my prophetic soul!” gasped Neale O’Neil.
“Costello, the junkman!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Dear, me! We thought we could see Mr. Howbridge
before that man came.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Tell me what it means,” urged the clerk.
“Then I will know what to say to the lunatic.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I guess he’s a nut all right,” admitted Neale.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166'></a>166</span>
He told the lawyer’s clerk swiftly all they knew
about the junkman, and all they knew about the
silver bracelet.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“All right. It is something for Mr. Howbridge
to attend to himself,” declared the clerk. “You
hang on to that bracelet and don’t let anybody
have it. I’ll try to shoo off this fellow. Anyway,
it may not belong to his family at all. I’ll hold
him here till you two get away.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Neale and Agnes were glad to escape contact
with the junkman again. He was too vehement.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“He’ll walk right in and search the house for
the thing,” grumbled Neale. “We can’t have
him frightening the children.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“And I don’t want to be frightened myself,”
added Agnes.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
They hurried home, and all that day, every time
the bell rang or she heard a voice at the side door,
the girl felt a sudden qualm. “Wish we had never
advertised that bracelet at all,” she confessed in
secret. “Dear, me! I wonder what Ruth will
say?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Nevertheless she failed to take her older sister
into her confidence regarding Queen Alma’s
bracelet when she wrote to her. She felt quite
convinced that Ruth would not approve of what
she and Neale had done, so why talk about it?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167'></a>167</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
This was the attitude Agnes maintained. Perhaps
the whole affair would be straightened out
before Ruth came back. And otherwise, she considered,
everything was going well at the Corner
House in Milton.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
It was Miss Ann Titus who evinced interest
next in the “lost and found” advertisement. Miss
Ann Titus was the woman whom Dot called “such
a fluid speaker” and who said so many “and-so’s”
that “ain’t-so’s.” In other words, Miss
Titus, the dressmaker, was a very gossipy person,
although she was not intentionally unkind.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
She came in this afternoon, “stopping by” as
she termed it, from spending a short sewing day
with Mrs. Pease, a Willow Street neighbor of the
Corner House girls.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“And I must say that Mrs. Pease, for a woman
of her age, has young idees about dress,” Miss
Titus confided to Mrs. McCall and Agnes, who
were in the sewing room. Aunt Sarah “couldn’t
a-bear” Miss Ann Titus, so they did not invite
the seamstress to go upstairs.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Yes, her idees is some young,” repeated Miss
Titus. “But then, nowadays if you foller the
styles in the fashion papers nobody can tell you
and your grandmother apart, back to! Skirts are
so skimpy—and <em>short</em>!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168'></a>168</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Miss Titus fanned herself rapidly, and allowed
her emphasis to suggest her own opinion of modern
taste in dress.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Of course, Mrs. Pease is slim and ain’t lost
all her good looks; but it does seem to me if I was
a married woman,” she simpered here a little, for
Miss Titus had by no means given up all hope of
entering the wedded state, “I should consider my
husband’s feelings. I would not go on the street
looking below my knees as though I was twelve
year old instead of thirty-two.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Maybe Mr. Pease likes her to look young,”
suggested Agnes.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Hech! Hech!” clucked Mrs. McCall placidly.
“Thirty-twa is not so very auld. Not as we live
these days, at any rate.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“But think of the example she sets her children,”
sniffed Miss Titus, bridling.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Tut, tut! How much d’you expect Margie and
Holly Pease is influenced by their mother’s style
o’ dress?” exclaimed the housekeeper. “The twa
bairns scarce know much about that.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I guess that is so,” chimed in Agnes. “And
I think she is a pretty woman and dresses nicely.
So there!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Ah, you young things cannot be expected to
think as I do,” smirked Miss Titus.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169'></a>169</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I take that as a compliment, my dear,” said
the housekeeper comfortably. “And I never expect
tae be vairy old until I die. Still and all, I
am some older than Agnes.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“That reminds me,” said Miss Titus, more
briskly (though it did not remind her, for she had
come into the Corner House for the special purpose
of broaching the subject that she now announced),
“which of you Kenways is it has found
a silver bracelet?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Now, <em>that</em> is Agnes’ affair,” chuckled Mrs.
McCall.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh! It is not Ruth that advertised?” queried
the curious Miss Titus.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Na, na! Tell it her, Agnes,” said the housekeeper.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
But Agnes was not sure she wished to describe
to this gossipy seamstress all the incidents connected
with Queen Alma’s bracelet. She only
said:
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Of course, you do not know anybody who has
lost such a bracelet?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“How can I tell till I have seen it?” demanded
Miss Titus.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Well, we have about decided that until somebody
comes who describes the bracelet and can
explain how and where it was lost that we had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170'></a>170</span>
better not display it at all,” Agnes said, with
more firmness than was usual with her.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh!” sniffed Miss Titus. “I hope you do not
think that <em>I</em> have any interest—any personal interest—in
inquiring about it?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“If I thought it was yours, Miss Titus, I would
let you see it immediately,” Agnes hastened to
assure her. “But of course—”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“There was a bracelet lost right on this street,”
said Miss Titus earnestly, meaning Willow Street
and pointing that way, “that never was recovered
to my knowledge.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh! You don’t mean it?” cried the puzzled
girl. “Of course, we don’t <em>know</em> that this one
belongs to any of those Gypsies—”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I should say not!” clucked Miss Titus. “The
bracelet I mean was worn by Sarah Turner. She
and I went together regular when we were girls.
And going to prayer meeting one night, walking
along here by the old Corner House, Sarah
dropped her bracelet.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“But—but!” gasped Agnes, “that must have
been some time ago, Miss Titus.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“It is according to how you compute time,” the
dressmaker said. “Sarah and I were about of an
age. And she isn’t more than forty years old
right now!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171'></a>171</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I don’t think this bracelet we have is the one
your friend lost,” Agnes said faintly, but confidently.
She wanted to laugh but did not dare.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“How do you know?” demanded Miss Ann
Titus in her snappy way—like the biting off of a
thread when she was at work. “I should know
it, even so long after it was lost, I assure you.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Why—how?” asked the Corner House girl
curiously.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“By the scratches on it,” declared Miss Titus.
“Sarah’s brother John made them with his
pocketknife—on the inside of the bracelet—to see
if it was real silver. Oh! he was a bad boy—as
bad as Sammy Pinkney. And what do you think
of <em>his</em> running away again?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Agnes was glad the seamstress changed the
subject right here. It seemed to her as though
she had noticed scratches on the bracelet the
Gypsies had placed in the basket the children
bought. Could it be possible—
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“No! That is ridiculous!” Agnes told herself.
“It could not be possible that a bracelet lost forty
years ago on Willow Street should turn up at this
late date. And, having found it, why should those
Gypsy women give it to Tess and Dot? There
would be no sense in that.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Yet, when the talkative Miss Titus had gone
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172'></a>172</span>
Agnes went to the room the little folks kept their
playthings and doll families in, and picked up the
Alice-doll which chanced that day to be wearing
the silver band. She removed it from the doll and
took it to the window where the light was better.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Yes! It was true as she had thought. There
were several crosswise scratches on the inside of
the circlet. They might easily have been made by
a boy’s jackknife.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I declare! Who really knows where this
bracelet came from, and who actually owns it?
Maybe it is not Queen Alma’s ornament after all.
Dear, me! this Kenway family is forever getting
mixed up in difficulties that positively have nothing
to do with <em>us</em>.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“The silly old bracelet! Why couldn’t those
Gypsy women have sold that basket to Margaret
and Holly Pease, or to some other little girls instead
of to our Tess and Dot. Mrs. McCall says
that some people seem to attract trouble, just as
lightning-rods attract lightning, and I guess the
Kenways are some of those people!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Neale did not come over again that day, so she
had nobody to discuss this new slant in the matter
with. And if Agnes could not “talk out loud”
about her troubles, she was apt to grow irritable.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173'></a>173</span>
At least, the little girls said after supper that she
was cross.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Ruth doesn’t talk that way to us,” declared
Tess, quite hurt, and gathering up her playthings
from the various chairs in the sitting room where
the family usually gathered in the evenings. “I
don’t think I should like her to be away all the
time.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
This was Tess’s polite way of criticising Agnes.
But Dot was not so hampered by politeness.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Crosspatch!” she exclaimed. “That’s just
what you are, Aggie Kenway.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
And she started for bed in quite a huff. Agnes
was glad, a few minutes later, that the two smaller
girls had gone upstairs, even if they had gone
away in this unhappy state of mind. Mrs. McCall
had come in and sat down at some mending
and the room was very quiet. Suddenly a noise
outside on the porch made Agnes raise her head
and look at the nearest window.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“What is the matter wi’ ye, lassie?” asked
Mrs. McCall, startled.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Did you hear that?” whispered the girl, staring
at the window.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
The shade was not drawn down to the sill, and
the curtains were the very thinnest of scrim. At
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174'></a>174</span>
the space of four inches below the shade Agnes
saw a white splotch against the pane.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh! See! A face!” gasped Agnes in three
smothered shrieks.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Hech, mon! Such a flibbertigibbet as the lass
is.” Mrs. McCall adjusted her glasses and
stared, first at the frightened girl, then at the window.
But she, too, saw the face. “What can the
matter be?” she demanded, half rising. “Is that
Neale O’Neil up tae some o’ his jokes?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh, no, Mrs. Mac! It’s not Neale,” half
sobbed Agnes. “I know who it is. It’s that awful
junkman!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“A junkman?” repeated Mrs. McCall. “At
this time o’ night? We’ve naethin’ tae sellit him.
The impudence!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
She rose, quite determined to drive the importunate
junkman away.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175'></a>175</span><a name='chXIX' id='chXIX'></a>CHAPTER XIX—THE HOUSE IS HAUNTED</h2>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Why do ye fash yoursel’ so?” demanded Mrs.
McCall in growing wonder and exasperation.
“Let me see the foolish man.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
She approached the window and raised the
shade sharply. Then she hoisted the sash itself.
But Costello, the junkman, was gone.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“There is naebody here,” she complained,
looking out on the side porch.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“But he <em>was</em> there! You saw him,” faintly
declared Agnes.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“He was nae ghost, if that’s what you mean,”
said the housekeeper dryly. “But what and who
is he? A junkman? How do you come to know
junkmen, lassie?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I only know that junkman,” explained Agnes.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Aye?” The housekeeper’s eyes as well as her
voice was sharp. “And when did you make his
acquaintance? Costello, d’you say?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“So he said his name was. He—he is one of
the Gypsies, I do believe!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Gypsies! The idea! Is the house surrounded
by Gypsies?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176'></a>176</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I don’t know, Mrs. McCall,” said Agnes
faintly. “I only know they are giving us a lot
of trouble.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Who are?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“The Gypsies.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Hear the lass!” exclaimed the troubled housekeeper.
“Who ever heard the like? Why should
Gypsies give us any trouble? Is it that bit bracelet
the bairns play wi’? Then throw it out and
let the Gypsies have it.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“But that would not be right, would it, Mrs.
McCall?” demanded the troubled girl. “If—if
the bracelet belongs to them—”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Hech! To this junkman?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“He claims it,” confessed Agnes.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Tut, tut! What is going on here that I do
not know about?” demanded the Scotch woman
with deeper interest.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
She closed the window, drew the shade again,
and returned to her seat. She stared at Agnes
rather sternly over her glasses.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Come now, my lass,” said the housekeeper,
“what has been going on so slyly here? I never
heard of any Costello, junkman or not. Who is
he? What does he want, peering in at a body’s
windows at night?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Agnes told the whole story then—and managed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177'></a>177</span>
to tell it clearly enough for the practical woman
to gain a very good idea of the whole matter.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Of course,” was her comment, grimly said,
“you and that Neale could not let well enough
alone. You never can. If you had not advertised
the bit bracelet, this junkman would not have
troubled you.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“But we thought it ought to be advertised,”
murmured Agnes in defense.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Aye, aye! Ye thought mooch I’ve nae doot.
And to little good purpose. Well, ’tis a matter
for Mr. Howbridge now, sure enough. And what
he’ll say—”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“But I hope that Costello does not come to the
house again,” ventured the girl, in some lingering
alarm.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“You or Neale go to Mr. Howbridge’s clerk in
the morning and tell him. He should tell the
police of this crazy man. A Gypsy, too, you
say?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I think he must be. The bracelet seems to be
a bone of contention between two branches of the
Gypsy tribe. If it belonged to that old Queen
Alma—”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Fiddle-faddle!” exclaimed the housekeeper.
“Who ever heard of a queen among those dirty
Gypsies? ’Tis foolishness.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178'></a>178</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
The fact that Costello, the junkman, was lingering
about the old Corner House was not to be denied.
They saw him again before bedtime. Uncle
Rufus had gone to bed and Linda was so easily
frightened that Mrs. McCall did not want to
tell her.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
So the housekeeper grabbed a broom and
started out on the side porch with the avowed
intention of “breaking the besom over the chiel’s
head!” But the lurker refused to be caught and
darted away into the shadows. And all without
making a sound, or revealing in any way what
his intention might be.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Mrs. McCall and the trembling Agnes went all
about the house, locking each lower window, and
of course all the doors. Tom Jonah, the old Newfoundland
dog, slept out of doors these warm
nights, and sometimes wandered away from the
premises.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“We ought to have Buster, Sammy Pinkney’s
bulldog, over here. Then that horrid man would
not dare come into the yard,” Agnes said.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“You might as well turn that old billy-goat
loose,” sniffed Mrs. McCall. “He’d do little
more harm than that bull pup—and nae more
good, either.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
They went to bed—earlier than usual, perhaps.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179'></a>179</span>
And that may be the reason why Agnes could not
sleep. She considered the possibility of Costello’s
climbing up the porch posts to the roof, and so
reaching the second story windows.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“If he is going to haunt the house like this,”
Agnes declared to the housekeeper in the morning,
“let us make Neale come here and stay at
night.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“That lad?” returned the housekeeper, who
had no very exalted opinion of boys in any case—no
more than had Ruth. “Haven’t we all troubles
enough, I want to know? This is a case for the
police. You go tell Mr. Howbridge’s clerk about
the Gypsy, that is what you do.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
But Agnes would not do even that without taking
Neale into her confidence. Neale at once was
up in arms when he heard of the lurking junkman.
He declared he would come over and hide in the
closet on the Kenways’ back porch and try to
catch the man if he appeared again at night.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“He is a very strong man, Neale,” objected
Agnes. “And he might have a knife, too. You
know, those Gypsies are awfully fierce-tempered.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I don’t know that he is,” objected Neale. “He
looked to me like just plain crazy.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Well, you come down to the office with me,”
commanded Agnes. “I don’t even want to meet
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180'></a>180</span>
that excitable Costello man on the street when I
am alone.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I suppose you are scared, Aggie. But I don’t
think he would really hurt you. Come on!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
So they went down to Mr. Howbridge’s office
again and interviewed the clerk, telling him first
of all of the appearance of the junkman the night
before.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I had fairly to drive him out of these offices,”
said the clerk. “He is of a very excitable temperament,
to say the least. But I did not think
there was any real harm in him.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Just the same,” Neale objected, “he wants to
keep away from the house and not frighten folks
at night.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh, we will soon stop that,” said Mr. Howbridge’s
representative. “I will report it to the
police.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“But perhaps he does not mean any harm,”
faltered Agnes.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I do not think he does,” said the man.
“Nevertheless, we will warn him.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
This promise relieved Agnes a good deal. She
was tender-hearted and she did not wish the junkman
arrested. But when evening came and he
once more stared in at the windows, and tapped
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181'></a>181</span>
on the panes, and wandered around and around
the house—
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Well, this is too much!” cried the girl, when
Neale and Mrs. McCall both ran out to try to
apprehend the marauder. “I do wish we had a
telephone. I am going to <em>beg</em> Ruth to have one
put in just as soon as she comes back. We could
call the police and they would catch that man.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Perhaps the police, had they been informed,
might have caught Costello. But Mrs. McCall
and Neale did not. The latter remained until the
family went to bed and then the boy did a little
lurking in the bushes on his own account. But
he did not spy the strange man again.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
In the morning, without saying anything to the
Kenway family about it, Neale O’Neil set out to
find Costello, the junkman. He certainly was not
afraid of the man by daylight. He had had experience
with him.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
From Mr. Howbridge’s clerk he had already
obtained the address the junkman had given when
he was at the office. The place was down by the
canal in the poorer section of the town, of
course.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
There were several cellars and first-floors of old
houses given up to ragpickers and dealers in junk
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182'></a>182</span>
of all kinds. After some inquiry among a people
who quite evidently were used to dodging the
answering of incriminating questions, Neale
learned that there had been a junkman living in
a certain room up to within a day or two before,
whose name was Costello. But he had disappeared.
Oh, yes! Neale’s informant was quite
sure that Costello had gone away for good.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“But he had a horse and wagon. He had a
business of his own. Where has he gone?” demanded
the boy.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
He was gone. That was all these people would
tell him. They pointed out the old shed where
Costello had kept his horse. Was it a good horse?
It was a good looking horse, with smiles which
seemed to indicate that Costello was a true Gypsy
and was not above “doctoring” a horse into a
deceiving appearance of worthiness.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“He drove away with that horse. He did not
say where he was going. I guess he go to make
a sale, eh? He will come back with some old plug
that he make look fine, eh?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
This was the nearest to real information that
Neale could obtain, and this from a youth who
worked for one of the established junk dealers.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
So Neale had to give up the inquiry as useless.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183'></a>183</span>
When he came back to the old Corner House he
confessed to Agnes:
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“He is hiding somewhere, and coming around
here after dark. Wish I had a shotgun—”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh, Neale! How wicked!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Loaded with rock-salt,” grinned the boy. “A
dose of that might do the Gyp. a world of good.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184'></a>184</span><a name='chXX' id='chXX'></a>CHAPTER XX—PLOTTERS AT WORK</h2>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
The adventures of the Corner House girls and
their friends did not usually include anything
very terrible. Perhaps there was no particular
peril threatened by Costello, the Gypsy junkman,
who was lurking about the premises at night.
Just the same, Agnes Kenway was inclined to do
what Mrs. McCall suggested and throw the silver
bracelet out upon the ash heap.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Of course they had no moral right to do that,
and the housekeeper’s irritable suggestion was
not to be thought of for a serious moment. Yet
Agnes would have been glad to get rid of the
responsibility connected with possession of Queen
Alma’s ornament.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“If it is that Costello heirloom!” she said.
“Maybe after all it belongs to Miss Ann Titus’s
friend, Sarah Whatshername. Goodness! I wonder
how many other people will come to claim
the old thing. I do wish Ruth would return.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Just so you could hand the responsibility over
to her,” accused Neale.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185'></a>185</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“M-mm. Well?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“We ought to hunt up those Gypsies—‘Beeg
Jeem’ and his crowd—and get their side of the
story,” declared Neale.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“No! I will not!” cried Agnes. “I have met
all the Gypsies I ever want to meet.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
But within the hour she met another. She was
in the kitchen, and Linda and Mrs. McCall were
both in the front of the house, cleaning. There
came a timid-sounding rap on the door. Agnes
unthinkingly threw it open.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
A slender girl stood there—a girl younger
than Agnes herself. This stranger was very
ragged, not at all clean looking, and very brown.
She had flashing white teeth and flashing black
eyes.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Agnes actually started back when she saw her
and suppressed a scream. For she instantly knew
the stranger was one of the Gypsy tribe. That
she seemed to be alone was the only thing that
kept Agnes from slamming the door again right
in the girl’s face.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Will the kind lady give me something to eat?”
whined the beggar. “I am hungry. I eat nothing
all the day.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Agnes was doubtful of the truth of this. The
dark girl did not look ill-fed. But she had an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186'></a>186</span>
appearance of need just the same; and it was a
rule of the Corner House household never to turn
a hungry person away.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Stay there on the mat,” Agnes finally said.
“Don’t come in. I will see what I can find for
you.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Yes, Ma’am,” said the girl.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Haven’t you had any breakfast?” asked
Agnes, moving toward the pantry, and her sympathies
becoming excited.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“No, Ma’am. And no supper last night. Nobody
give me nothing.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Well,” said Agnes, with more warmth, expanding
to this tale of woe, as was natural, “I
will see what I can find.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
She found a plate heaped with bread and meat
and a wedge of cake, which she brought to the
screen door. The girl had stood there motionless,
only her black eyes roved about the kitchen and
seemed to mark everything in it.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Sit down there on the steps and eat it,” said
Agnes, passing the plate through a narrow opening,
as she might have handed food into the cage
of an animal at a menagerie. She really was half
afraid of the girl just because she looked so much
like a Gypsy.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
The stranger ate as though she was quite as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187'></a>187</span>
ravenously hungry as she had claimed to be.
There could be no doubt that the food disappeared
with remarkable celerity. She sat for a moment
or two after she had eaten the last crumb with the
plate in her lap. Then she rose and brought it
timidly to the door.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Did you have enough?” asked Agnes, feeling
less afraid now.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh, yes, Lady! It was so nice,” and the girl
flashed her teeth in a beaming smile. She was
quite a pretty girl—if she had only been clean
and decently dressed.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
She handed the plate to Agnes, and then turned
and ran out of the yard and down the street as
fast as she could run. Agnes stared after her in
increased amazement. Why had she run away?
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“If she is a Gypsy—Well, they are queer
people, that is sure. Oh! What is this?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Her fingers had found something on the under
side of the plate. She turned it up and saw a
soiled piece of paper sticking there. Agnes, wondering,
if no longer alarmed, drew the paper from
the plate, turned it over, and saw that some words
were scrawled in blue pencil on the paper.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Goodness me! More mysteries!” gasped the
Corner House girl.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Briefly and plainly the message read: <em>Do not</em>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188'></a>188</span>
<em>give the bracelet to Miguel. He is a thief.</em>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Agnes sat down and stared almost breathlessly
at the paper. That it was a threatening command
from one crowd of Gypsies or the other, she was
sure. But whether it was from Big Jim’s crowd
or from Costello, the junkman, she did not know.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Her first thought, after she had digested the
matter for a few moments, was to run with the
paper to Mrs. McCall. But Mrs. McCall was not
at all sympathetic about this bracelet matter. She
was only angry with the Gypsies, and, perhaps, a
little angry with Agnes for having unwittingly
added to the trouble by putting the advertisement
in the paper.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Neale, after all, could be her only confident;
and, making sure that no other dark-visaged person
was in sight about the house, the girl ran
down the long yard beyond the garden to the
stable and Billy Bumps’ quarters, and there
climbed the board fence that separated the Kenway
yard from that of Con Murphy, the cobbler.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Hoo, hoo! Hoo, hoo!” Agnes called, looking
over the top rail of the fence.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Hoo, hoo, yerself!” croaked a voice. “I’d
have yez know we kape no owls on these
premises.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
The bent figure of Mr. Murphy, always busy at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189'></a>189</span>
his bench, was visible through the back window of
his shop.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Is it that young yahoo called Neale O’Neil
that yez want, Miss Aggie?” added the smiling
cobbler. “If so—”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
But Neale O’Neil appeared just then to answer
to the summons of his girl friend. He had been
to the store, and he tumbled all his packages on
Con’s bench to run out into the yard to greet
Agnes.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“What’s happened now?” he cried, seeing in
the girl’s face that something out of the ordinary
troubled her.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh, Neale! what do you think?” she gasped.
“There’s been another of them at the house.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Not one of those Gypsies?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I believe she was.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh! A <em>she</em>!” said the boy, much relieved.
“Well, she didn’t bite you, of course?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Come here and look at this,” commanded his
friend.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Neale went to the fence, climbed up and took
the paper that Agnes had found stuck to the plate
on which she had placed the food for the Gypsy
girl. When he had read the abrupt and unsigned
message, Neale began to grow excited, too.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Where did you get this?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190'></a>190</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Agnes told him about it. Of course, the hungry
girl had been a messenger from one party of
Gypsies or the other. Which? was Agnes’ eager
question.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Guess I can answer that,” Neale said gravely.
“It does look as though things were getting complicated.
I bet this girl you fed is one of Big
Jim’s bunch.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“How can you be so positive?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“There are probably only two parties of
Gypsies fighting over the possession of that old
bracelet. Now, I learned down there in that junk
neighborhood that Costello—the Costello who is
bothering us—is called Miguel. They are all
Costellos—Big Jim’s crowd and all. June Wildwood
says so. They distinguish our junkman
from themselves by calling him by his first name.
Therefore—”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh, of course I see,” sighed Agnes. “It is a
terrible mess, Neale! I do wish Mr. Howbridge
would get back. Or that the police would find that
junkman and shut him up. Or—or that Ruthie
would come home!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh, don’t be a baby, Aggie!” ejaculated
Neale.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Who is the baby, I want to know?” flashed
back the girl. “I’m not!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191'></a>191</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Then pluck up your spirits and don’t turn on
the sprinkler,” said the slangy youth. “Why,
this is nothing to cry about. When it is all over
we shall be looking back at the mystery as something
great in our young lives.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“You can try to laugh if you want to,” snapped
Agnes. “But being haunted by a junkman, and
getting notes from Gypsies like that! Huh! who
wouldn’t be scared? Why, we don’t know what
those people might do to us if we give up the
bracelet to the wrong person.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“It doesn’t belong to any of the Gypsies,
perhaps.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“That is exactly it!” she cried. “Maybe, after
all, it is the property of Miss Ann Titus’ friend,
Sarah.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“And was lost somewhere on Willow Street—about
where your garage now stands—forty years
ago!” scoffed Neale. “Well, you are pretty soft,
Agnes Kenway.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
This naturally angered the girl, and she pouted
and got down from the fence without replying.
As she went back up the yard she saw Mrs. Pinkney,
with her head tied up with a towel, shaking
a dustcloth at one of her front windows. It at
least changed the current of the girl’s thought.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh, Mrs. Pinkney!” she cried, running across
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192'></a>192</span>
the street to speak to Sammy’s mother, “have
you heard anything?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“About Sammy? Not a word,” answered the
woman. “I have to keep working all the time,
Agnes Kenway, or I should go insane. I know I
should! I have cleaned this whole house, from
attic to cellar, three times since Sammy ran
away.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Why, Mrs. Pinkney! If you don’t go insane—and
I don’t believe you will—I am sure you will
overwork and be ill.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I must keep doing. I must keep going. If I
sit down to think I imagine the most horrible
things happening to the dear child. It is awful!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Agnes knew that never before had the woman
been so much disturbed by her boy’s absences
from home. It seemed as though she really had
lost control of herself, and the Corner House girl
was quite worried over Mrs. Pinkney.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“If we could only help you and Mr. Pinkney,”
said Agnes doubtfully. “Do you suppose it
would do any good to go off in the car again—Neale
and me and your husband—to look for
Sammy?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Mr. Pinkney is so tied down by his business
that he cannot go just now,” she sighed. “And
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193'></a>193</span>
he has put the search into the hands of an agency.
I did not want the police to get after Sammy. But
what could we do? And they say there are Gypsies
around.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh!” gasped Agnes. “Do you suppose—?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“You never can tell what those people will do.
I am told they have stolen children.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Isn’t that more talk than anything else?”
asked Agnes, trying to speak quite casually.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I don’t know. One of my neighbors tells me
she hears that there is a big encampment of Gypsies
out on the Buckshot Road. You know, out
beyond the Poole farm. They have autovans instead
of horses, so they say, and maybe could
carry any children they stole out of the state in
a very short time.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh, dear me, Mrs. Pinkney! I would not think
of such things,” Agnes urged. “It does not
sound reasonable.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“That the Gypsies should travel by auto instead
of behind horse?” rejoined Sammy’s
mother. “Why not? Everybody else is using
automobiles for transportation. I tell Mr. Pinkney
that if we had a machine perhaps Sammy
might not have been so eager to leave home.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh, dear, me!” thought Agnes, as she made
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194'></a>194</span>
her way home again, “I am sorry for Mr. Pinkney.
Just now I guess he is having a hard time
at home as well as at business!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
But she treasured up what she had heard about
the Gypsy encampment on the Buckshot Road to
tell Neale—when she should not be so “put-out”
with him. The Buckshot Road was in an entirely
different direction from Milton than that they had
followed in their automobile on the memorable
search for Sammy. Agnes did not suppose for
a moment that the missing boy had gone with
the Gypsies.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195'></a>195</span><a name='chXXI' id='chXXI'></a>CHAPTER XXI—TESS AND DOT TAKE A HAND</h2>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Up to this time Tess and Dot Kenway had
heard nothing about the Gypsy junkman haunting
the house at night, or about other threatening
things connected with the wonderful silver
bracelet.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Their young minds were quite as excited
about the ornament as in the beginning, however;
for in the first place they had to keep run
exactly of whose turn it was to “wear” the
Gypsies’ gift.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I don’t see what we’ll do about it when Alice
grows up,” Dot said. She was always looking
forward in imagination to the time when her
favorite doll should become adult. “She will want
to wear that belt, Tess, for evening dress. You
know, a lady’s jewelry should belong to her.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I’m not going to give up my share to your
Alice-doll,” announced Tess, quite firmly for her.
“And, anyway, you must not be so sure that it is
going to be ours all the time. See! Aggie says
we can’t take it out of the house to play with.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196'></a>196</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I don’t care!” whined Dot. “I don’t want to
give it back to those Gypsy ladies.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Neither do I. But we must of course, if we can
find them. Honest is honest.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“It—it’s awful uncomfortable to be so dreadful’
honest,” blurted out the smaller girl. “And I
think they meant us to have the bracelet.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“All right, then. It’s only polite to offer it back
to them. Then if they don’t want it we’ll know
that it is ours and even Ruth won’t say anything.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“But—but when my Alice-doll grows up—”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Now, don’t be a little piggie, Dot Kenway!”
exclaimed Tess, rather crossly. “When your
wrist gets big enough so the bracelet won’t slip
over your hand so easy, you will want to wear it
yourself—just as I do. And Agnes wants it, too.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh! But it’s ours—if it isn’t the Gypsy ladies’,”
Dot hastened to say.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Two claimants for the ornament were quite
enough. She did not wish to hear of any other
people desiring to wear it.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
As it chanced, Tess and Dot heard about the
Gypsy encampment on the Buckshot Road through
the tongue of neighborhood gossip, quite as had
Sammy’s mother. Margaret and Holly Pease
heard the store man tell their mother; and having
enviously eyed the silver bracelet in the possession
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197'></a>197</span>
of the Kenway girls, they ran to tell the latter
about the Gypsies.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“They’ve come back,” declared Margaret decidedly,
“to look for that bracelet you’ve got.
You’ll see them soon enough.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh, Margie! do you think so?” murmured
Tess, while Dot was immediately so horror-stricken
that tears came to her eyes.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Maybe they will bring the police and have you
locked up,” continued the cheerful Pease child.
“You know they might accuse you of stealing the
bracelet.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“We never!” wailed Dot. “We never! They
gave it to us!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Well, they are going to take it back, so now!”
Margaret Pease declared.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I don’t think it is nice of you to say what you
do, Margie,” said Tess. “Everybody knows we
are honest. Why! if Dot and I knew how to find
them, we would take the bracelet right to the
Gypsy ladies. Wouldn’t we, Dot?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“But—but we don’t know where to find them,”
blurted out the youngest Corner House girl.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“You can find them I guess—out on the Buckshot
Road.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“We don’t know that <em>our</em> Gypsy ladies are
there,” said Tess, with some defiance.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198'></a>198</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“You don’t dare go to see,” said Margaret
Pease.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
It was a question to trouble the minds of Tess
and Dot. Should they try to find the Gypsies, and
see if the very ladies who had given them the
bracelet were in that encampment?
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
At least it was a leading question in Tess Kenway’s
mind. It must be confessed that Dot only
hoped it would prove a false alarm. She was very
grateful to the strange Gypsy women for having
put the silver ornament in the green and yellow
basket; but she hoped never to see those two kind
women again!
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
The uncertainty was so great in both of the
small girls’ minds that they said nothing at all
about it in the hearing of any other member of the
family. Had Ruth been at home they might have
confided in her. They had always confided everything
to their eldest sister. But just now the two
smaller Corner House girls were living their own
lives, very much shut away from the existence Agnes,
for instance, was leading.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Agnes had a secret—several of them, indeed.
She did not take Tess and Dot into her confidence.
So, if for no other reason, the smaller girls did
not talk to Agnes about the Gypsies.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
The Kenways owned some tenement property in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199'></a>199</span>
a much poorer part of the town than that prominent
corner on which the Corner House stood.
Early in their coming to Milton from Bloomsburg,
the Corner House girls had become acquainted
with the humble tenants whose rents helped swell
the funds which Mr. Howbridge cared for and administered.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Some of these poorer people, especially the children
near their own age, interested the Kenway
girls very much because they met these poorer
children in school. So when news was brought to
Agnes one afternoon (it was soon after lunch)
that Maria Maroni, whose father kept the coal,
wood, ice and vegetable cellar in one of the Stower
houses and who possessed a wife and big family of
children as well, had been taken ill, Agnes was
much disturbed.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Agnes liked Maria Maroni. Maria was very
bright and forward in her studies and was a pretty
Italian girl, as well. The Maronis lived much better
than they once had, too. They now occupied
one of the upstairs tenements over Mrs. Kranz’s
delicatessen store, instead of all living in the basement.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
The boy who ran into the Kenway yard and told
Agnes this while she was tying up the gladioli
stems after a particularly hard night’s rain, did
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200'></a>200</span>
not seem to be an Italian. Indeed, he was no boy
that Agnes ever remembered having seen before.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
But tenants were changing all the time over
there where Maria lived. This might be a new boy
in that neighborhood. And, anyway, Agnes was
not bothered in her mind much about the boy. It
was Maria’s illness that troubled her.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“What is the matter with the poor girl?” Agnes
wanted to know. “What does the doctor say
it is?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“They ain’t got no doc,” said the boy. “She’s
just sick, Maria is. I don’t know what she’s got
besides.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
This sounded bad enough to Agnes. And the
fact that the sick girl had no medical attention was
the greater urge for the Kenway girl to do something
about it. Of course, Joe and his wife must
have a doctor for Maria at once.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Agnes went into the house and told Mrs. McCall
about it. She even borrowed the green and yellow
basket from the little girls and packed some jelly
and a bowl of broth and other nice things to take
to Maria Maroni. The Kenways seldom went to
the tenements empty-handed.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
She would have taken Neale with her, only she
felt that after their incipient “quarrel” of the
previous morning she did not care immediately to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201'></a>201</span>
make up with the boy. Sometimes she felt that
Neale O’Neil took advantage of her easy disposition.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
So Agnes went off alone with her basket. Half
an hour later a boy rang the front door bell of the
Corner House. He had a note for Mrs. McCall.
It was written in blue pencil, and while the housekeeper
was finding her reading glasses the messenger
ran away so that she could not question
him.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
The note purported to be from Hedden, Mr.
Howbridge’s butler. It said that the lawyer had
been “brought home” and had asked for Mrs. McCall
to be sent for. It urged expedition in her
answer to the request, and it threw Mrs. McCall
into “quite a flutter” as she told Linda and Aunt
Sarah Maltby.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“The puir mon!” wailed the Scotch woman who
before she came to the old Corner House to care
for the Kenway household had been housekeeper
for Mr. Howbridge himself for many years.
“There is something sad happened to him, nae
doot. I must go awa’ wi’ me at aince. See to the
bairns, Miss Maltby, that’s the good soul. Even
Agnes is not in the hoose.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Of course I will see to them—if it becomes necessary,”
said Aunt Sarah.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202'></a>202</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Her idea of attending to the younger children,
however, was to remain in her own room knitting,
only occasionally going to the head of the back
stairs to ask Linda if Tess and Dot were all right.
The Finnish girl’s answer was always “Shure,
Mum,” and in her opinion Tess and Dot were all
right as long as she did not see that they were in
trouble.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
To tell the truth, Linda saw the smaller girls
very little after Mrs. McCall hurried out of the
house to take the street car for the lawyer’s residence.
Once Linda observed Tess and Dot in the
side yard talking to a boy through the pickets.
She had no idea that the sharp-featured boy was
the same who had brought the news of Maria Maroni’s
illness to Agnes, and the message from Hedden
to Mrs. McCall!
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
The boy in question had come slowly along the
pavement on Willow Street, muttering to himself
as he approached as though saying over several
sentences that he had learned by rote. He was
quite evidently a keen-minded boy, but he was not
at all a trustworthy looking one.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Tess and Dot both saw him, and that he was a
stranger made the little girls eye him curiously.
When he hailed them they were not quite sure
whether they ought to reply or not.
</p>

</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203'></a>203</span></div>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I guess you don’t know us,” Tess said doubtfully.
“You don’t belong in this neighborhood.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I know you all right,” said the boy. “You’re
the two girls those women sold the basket to. I
know you.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh!” gasped Tess.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“The Gypsy ladies!” murmured Dot.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“That’s the one. They sold you the basket for
forty-five cents. Didn’t they?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Yes,” admitted Tess.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“And it’s <em>ours</em>,” cried Dot. “We paid for it.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“That’s all right,” said the boy slowly. “But
you didn’t buy what was in it. No, sir! They
want it back.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh! The basket?” cried Tess.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“What you found in it.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
The boy seemed very sure of what he was saying,
but he spoke slowly.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“They want that silver thing back. It wasn’t
meant for you. It was a mistake. You know very
well it isn’t yours. If you are honest—and you
told them you were—you will bring it back to
them.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh! They did ask us if we were honest,” Tess
said faintly. “And of course we are. Aren’t we,
Dot?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Why—why— Do we have to be so dreadful’
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204'></a>204</span>
honest,” whispered the smallest Corner House
girl, quite borne down with woe.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Of course we have. Just think of what Ruthie
would say,” murmured Tess. Then to the boy:
“Where are those ladies?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Huh?” he asked. “What ladies?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“The Gypsy ladies we bought the basket from?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh, <em>them</em>?” he rejoined hurriedly, glancing
along the street with eagerness. “You go right
out along this street,” and he pointed in the direction
from which he had come. “You keep on walking
until you reach the brick-yard.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh! Are they camped there?” asked Tess.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“No. But a man with an automobile will meet
you there. He is a man who will take you right
to the Gypsy camp and bring you back again.
Don’t be afraid, kids. It’s all right.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
He went away then, and the little girls could not
call him back. They wanted to ask further questions;
but it was evident that the boy had
delivered his message and was not to be cross-examined.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“What <em>shall</em> we do?” Tess exclaimed.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh, let’s wait. Let’s wait till Ruth comes
home,” cried Dot, saying something very sensible
indeed.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
But responsibility weighed heavily on Tess’s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205'></a>205</span>
mind. She considered that if the Gypsy women
wished their bracelet returned, it was her duty to
take it to them without delay. Besides, there was
the man in the automobile waiting for them.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Why the man had not come to the house with
the car, or why he had not brought the two Gypsy
women to the Corner House, were queries that did
not occur to the little girls. If Tess Kenway was
nothing else, she was strictly honest.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“No,” she sighed, “we cannot wait. We must
go and see the women now. I will go in and get
the bracelet, Dot. Do you want your hat? Mrs.
McCall and Agnes are both away. We will have
to go right over and tend to this ourselves.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206'></a>206</span><a name='chXXII' id='chXXII'></a>CHAPTER XXII—EXCITEMENT GALORE</h2>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
When Agnes Kenway reached the tenement
where Maria Maroni resided and found that
brisk young person helping in the delicatessen
store as she did almost every day during the busy
hours and when there was no school, the Corner
House girl was surprised; but she was not
suspicious.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
That is, she was not suspicious of any plot
really aimed at the happiness of the Corner House
family. She merely believed that the strange boy
had deliberately fooled her for an idle purpose.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Maria Maroni! What do you think?” Agnes
burst out. “Who could that boy be? Oh, I’d
like to catch him! I’d make him sorry he told
me such a story.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“It is too bad you were troubled so, Agnes,”
said Maria, when she understood all about it. “I
can’t imagine who that boy could be. But I am
glad you came over to see us, never mind what
the reason is that brings you.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207'></a>207</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“A sight you are for sore eyes yet,” declared
the ponderous Mrs. Kranz, who had kissed Agnes
warmly when she first appeared. “Come the back
room in and sit down. Let Ikey tend to the customers
yet, Maria. We will visit with Agnes, and
have some tea and sweet crackers.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“And you must tell me of somebody in the row,
Mrs. Kranz, who needs these delicacies. Somebody
who is ill,” said Agnes. “I must not take
them home again. And Maria looks altogether
too healthy for jelly and chicken broth.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Mrs. Kranz laughed at that. But she added
with seriousness: “There is always somebody
sick here in the tenements, Miss Agnes. They
will not take care themselfs of—no! I tell them
warm flannels and good food is better than doctors yet.
But they will not mind me.” She
sighed.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Who is ill now?” asked Agnes, at once interested.
She loved to play “Lady Bountiful”; and,
really, the Kenway sisters had done a great deal
of good among their poor tenants and others in
the row.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Mrs. Leary. You know, her new baby died
and the poor woman,” said Maria quickly, “is sick
of grief, I do believe.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Ach, yes!” cried Mrs. Kranz. “She needs the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208'></a>208</span>
cheerful word. You see her, Miss Agnes. Then
she be better—sure!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Thank you!” cried Agnes, dimpling and
blushing. “Do you really think I can help
her?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“And there is little Susie Marowsky,” urged
the delicatessen shopkeeper. “That child is fading
away like a sick rose. She iss doing just that!
If she could have country eggs and country
milk—Ach! If we were all rich!” and she sighed
ponderously again.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I’ll tell our Ruth about her,” said Agnes
eagerly. “And I’ll see her, too, before I go home.
I’ll give her the broth, yes? And Mrs. Leary the
jelly, bread, and fruit?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“No!” cried Mrs. Kranz. “The fruit to Dominic
Nevin, the scissors grinder. He craves
fruit. You know, he cut his hand and got blood
poisoning, and it was so long yet that he could not
work. You see him, too, Miss Agnes.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
So altogether, what with the tea and cakes and
the visits to the sick, Agnes was away from the
Corner House quite three hours. When she was
on her way home she was delayed by an unforeseen
incident too.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
At the corner of Willow Street not far from the
brick-yard a figure suddenly darted into Agnes’
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209'></a>209</span>
path. She was naturally startled by the sudden
appearance of this figure, and doubly so when she
saw it was the Costello that she knew as the junkman,
and whose first name she now believed to be
Miguel.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“What do you want? Go away!” cried the girl
faintly, backing away from the vehement little
man.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh, do not be afraid! You are the honest
Kenway I am sure. You have Queen Alma’s
bracelet,” urged the little man. “You will give
her to me—yes?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I—I haven’t it,” cried Agnes, looking all
about for help and seeing nobody near.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Ha!” ejaculated the man. “You have not
give it to Beeg Jeem?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“We have given it to nobody. And we will not
let you or anybody have it until Mr. Howbridge
tells us what to do. Go away!” begged Agnes.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I go to that man. He no have the Queen Alma
bracelet. <em>You</em> have it—”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Just as sure as I get home,” cried the frightened
Agnes, “I will send that bracelet down to
the lawyer’s office and they must keep it. It shall
be in the house no longer! Don’t you dare come
there for it!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
She got past him then and ran as hard as she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210'></a>210</span>
could along Willow Street. When she finally
looked back she discovered that the man had not
followed her, but had disappeared.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh, dear me! I don’t care what the children
say. That bracelet goes into Mr. Howbridge’s
safe this very afternoon. Neale must take it there
for me,” Agnes Kenway decided.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
She reached the side door of the Corner House
just as Mrs. McCall entered the front door, having
got off the car at the corner. The housekeeper
came through the hall and into the rear premises
a good deal like a whirlwind. She was so excited
that Agnes forgot her own fright and stared at
the housekeeper breathlessly.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Is it you home again, Agnes Kenway?” cried
Mrs. McCall. “Well, thanks be for <em>that</em>. Then
you are all right.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Why, of course! Though he did scare me.
But what is the matter with you, Mrs. McCall?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“What is the matter wi’ me? A plenty. A
plenty, I tellit ye. If I had that jackanapes of a
boy I’d shake him well, so I would!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“What has Neale been doing now?” cried the
girl.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Not Neale.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Then is it Sammy?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Nor Sammy Pinkney. ’Tis that other lad that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211'></a>211</span>
came here wi’ a lying note tae get me clear across
town for naething!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Why, Mrs. McCall! what can you mean? Did
a boy fool you, too?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Hech!” The woman started and stared at the
girl. “Who brought you news of that little girl
being sick?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“But she wasn’t sick!” cried Agnes. “That
boy was an awful little story-teller.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Ye was fooled then? That Maria Maroni—”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Was not ill at all.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“And,” cried Mrs. McCall, “that boy who
brought a note to me from Hedden never came
from Mr. Howbridge’s house at all. It nearly
scar’t me tae death! It said Mr. Howbridge was
ill. He isn’t even at home yet, and when Mr.
Hedden heard from his master this morning he
was all right—the gude mon!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh, Mrs. McCall!” gasped Agnes, gazing at
the housekeeper with terrified visage. “What can
it mean?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Somebody has foolit us weel,” ejaculated the
enraged housekeeper.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“But why?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
The woman turned swiftly. She had grown
suddenly pale. She called up the back stairs for
Linda. A sleepy voice replied:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212'></a>212</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Here I be, mum!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Where are the children? Where are Tess and
Dot?” demanded Mrs. McCall, her voice husky.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“They was in the yard, mum, the last I see of
them.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“That girl!” ejaculated the housekeeper
angrily. “She neglects everything. If there’s
harm happened to those bairns—”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
She rushed to the porch. Uncle Rufus was
coming slowly up from the garden, hoe and rake
over his shoulder. It was evident that the old
colored man had been working steadily, and for
some time, among the vegetables.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh, Uncle Rufus!” cried the excited woman.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Ya-as’m! Ya-as’m! I’s a-comin’,” said the
old man rather querulously.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Step here a minute,” said Mrs. McCall.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I’s a-steppin’, Ma’am,” grumbled the other.
“Does seem as though dey wants me for fust one
t’ing an’ den anudder. I don’t no more’n git t’roo
one chore den sumpin’ else hops right out at me.
Lawsy me!” and he mopped his bald brown brow
with a big bandanna.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I only want to ask you something,” said the
housekeeper, less raspingly. “Are the little ones
down there? Have you seen them?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213'></a>213</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Them chillun? No’m. I ain’t seen ’em fo’
some time. They was playin’ up this-a-way den.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“How long ago?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I done reckon it was nigh two hours ago.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Hunt for them, Agnes!” gasped the housekeeper.
“I fear me something bad has happened.
You, Linda,” for the Finnish girl now appeared,
“run to the neighbors—all of them! See if you
can find those bairns.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Tess and Dottie, mum?” cried the Finnish
girl, already in tears. “Oh! they ain’t losted are
they?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“For all <em>you</em> know they are!” declared Mrs.
McCall. “Look around the house for them, Uncle
Rufus. I will look inside—”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“They may be upstairs with Aunt Sarah,”
cried Agnes, getting her breath at last.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I’ll know that in a moment!” declared Mrs.
McCall, and darted within.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Agnes ran in the other direction. She felt such
a lump in her throat that she could scarcely speak
or breathe. The possibility of something having
happened to the little girls—and with Ruth away!—cost
the second Corner House girl every last
bit of her self-control.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh, Neale! Neale!” she murmured over and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214'></a>214</span>
over again, as she ran to the lower end of the
premises.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
She fairly threw herself at the fence and scrambled
to her usual perch. There he was cleaning
Mr. Con Murphy’s yard.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Neale!” she gasped. At first he did not hear
her, but she drubbed upon the fence with the toes
of her shoes. “Neale!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Why, hullo, Aggie!” exclaimed the boy, turning
around and seeing her.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh, Neale! Come here!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
He was already coming closer. He saw that
again she was much overwrought.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“What has happened now?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Have you seen Tess and Dot?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Not to-day.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I—I mean within a little while? Two hours?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I tell you I have not seen them at all to-day. I
have been busy right here for Con.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Then they are gone! The Gypsies have got
them!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
For Agnes, without much logic of thought, had
immediately jumped to this conclusion. Neale
stared.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“What sort of talk is that, Agnes?” he demanded.
“You know that can’t be so.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215'></a>215</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I tell you it is so! It must be so! They got
Mrs. McCall and me out of the house—”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Who did?” interrupted Neale, getting hastily
over the fence and taking the girl’s hand. “Now,
tell me all about it—everything!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
As well as she could for her excitement and
fear, the girl told the story of the boy who had
brought her the false message about Maria Maroni,
and then about the message Mrs. McCall had
received calling her across town.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“It must be that they have kidnapped the children!”
moaned Agnes.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Not likely,” declared the boy. “The kids
have just gone visiting without asking leave. In
fact, there was nobody to ask. But I see that
there is a game on just the same.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
He started hastily for the Corner House and
Agnes trotted beside him.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“But where <em>are</em> Tess and Dot?” she demanded.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“How do I know?” he returned. “I want to
find out if there is something else missing.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“What do you mean?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“That bracelet.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Goodness, Neale! Is it that bracelet that has
brought us trouble again?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“It looks like a plot all right to me. A plot to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216'></a>216</span>
get you and Mrs. McCall out of the house so that
somebody could slip in and steal the bracelet.
Didn’t that ever occur to you?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Goodness me, Neale!” cried Agnes again, but
with sudden relief in her voice. “If that is all it
is I’ll be glad if the old bracelet is stolen. Then
it cannot make us any more trouble, that is one
sure thing!”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217'></a>217</span><a name='chXXIII' id='chXXIII'></a>CHAPTER XXIII—A SURPRISING MEETING</h2>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Tess and Dot Kenway, with no suspicion that
anything was awaiting them save the possible loss
of the silver bracelet, but otherwise quite enjoying
the adventure, walked hurriedly along Willow
Street as far as the brick-yard. That they were
disobeying a strict injunction in taking the bracelet
out of the house was a matter quite overlooked
at the time.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
They came to the corner and there, sure enough,
was a big, dusty automobile, with a big, dark man
in the driver’s seat. He smiled at the two little
girls and Tess remembered him instantly.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh, Dot!” she exclaimed, “it is the man we
saw in this auto with the young Gypsy lady when
we were driving home with Scalawag from
Mr. Howbridge’s the other day. Don’t you
remember?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Yes,” said Dot, with a sigh. “I guess it is
the same one. Oh, dear, me!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
For the nearer the time came to give up the
silver bracelet, the worse Dot felt about it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218'></a>218</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
The big Gypsy looked around at the two little
girls and smiled broadly.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“You leetle ladies tak’ ride with Beeg Jeem?”
he asked. “You go to see the poor Gypsy women
who let you have the fine bracelet to play with?
Yes?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“He knows all about it, Tess,” murmured Dot.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Yes, we will give them back the bracelet,”
Tess said firmly to the Gypsy man. “But we will
not give it up to anybody else.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Get right into my car,” said Big Jim, reaching
back to open the tonneau door. “You shall
be taken to the camp and there find the ones who
gave you the bracelet. Sure!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
There was something quite “grownupish” in
thus getting into the big car all alone, and Tess
and Dot were rather thrilled as they seated themselves
on the back seat and the Gypsy drove them
away.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Fifteen minutes or so later Agnes came to this
very corner and had her unpleasant interview
with Miguel Costello. But of course by that time
the children were far away.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
The big Gypsy drove them very rapidly and by
lonely roads into a part of the country that Tess
and Dot never remembered having seen before.
Whenever he saw anybody on the road, either
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219'></a>219</span>
afoot or in other cars, Big Jim increased his speed
and flashed by them so that there was little likelihood
of these other people seeing that the two
little girls were other than Gypsy girls.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
He did nothing to frighten Tess and Dot. Indeed,
he was so smiling and so pleasant that they
enjoyed the drive immensely and came finally in
a state of keen enjoyment to the camp which was
made a little back from the highway.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Well, if we have to give up the bracelet,”
sighed Tess, as they got out of the car, “we can
say that we have had a fine ride.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“That is all right. But how will my Alice-doll
feel when she finds out she can’t wear that pretty
belt again?” said Dot.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
There were many people in the camp, both men
and women and children. The latter kept at a
distance from Tess and Dot, but stared at them
very curiously. They kept the dogs away from
the visitors, too, and the little girls were glad of
that.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Where can we find the two ladies that—that
sold us the basket?” asked Tess politely, of Big
Jim.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“You look around, leetle ladies. You find,” he
assured them.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
There were four or five motor vans of good
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220'></a>220</span>
size in which the Gypsies evidently lived while
they were traveling. But there were several tents
set up as well. It was a big camp.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Timidly at first the two sisters, hand in hand,
the silver bracelet firmly clutched inside Tess’s
dress against her side, began walking about. They
tried to ask questions about the women they
sought; but nobody seemed to understand. They
all smiled and shook their heads.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Dear me! it must be dreadful to be born a
foreigner,” Dot finally said. “How can they
make themselves understood <em>at all</em>?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“But they seem to be very pleasant persons,”
Tess rejoined decidedly.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
The children ran away from them. Perhaps
they had been ordered to by the older Gypsies.
By and by Tess, at least, grew somewhat worried
when they did not find either of the women who
had sold them the yellow and green basket. Dot,
secretly, hoped the two in question had gone
away.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Suddenly, however, the two Kenway girls came
face to face with somebody they did know. But
so astonished were they by this discovery that for
a long minute neither could believe her eyes!
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Sammy Pinkney!” gasped Tess at last.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221'></a>221</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“It—ain’t—<em>never</em>!” murmured the smaller
girl.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
The figure which had tried to dodge around the
end of a motor van to escape observation looked
nothing at all like the Sammy Pinkney the Kenway
girls had formerly known. Never in their
experience of Sammy—not even when he had
slipped down the chimney at the old Corner House
and landed on the hearth, a very sooty Santa
Claus—had the boy looked so disgracefully ragged
and dirty.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Well, what’s the matter with me?” he demanded
defiantly.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Why—why there looks to be most <em>every</em>thing
the matter with you, Sammy Pinkney,” declared
Tess, with disgust. “What <em>do</em> you s’pose your
mother would say to you?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I ain’t going home to find out,” said Sammy.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“And—and your pants are all tored,” gasped
Dot.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh, that happened long ago,” said Sammy,
quite as airy as the trousers. “And I’m having
the time of my life here. Nobody sends me errands,
or makes me—er—weed beet beds! So
there! I can do just as I please.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“You look as though you had, Sammy,” was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222'></a>222</span>
Tess’s critical speech. “I guess your mother
wouldn’t want you home looking the way you do.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I look well enough,” he declared defiantly.
“And don’t you tell where I am. Will you?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“But, Sammy!” exclaimed Dot, “you ran away
to be a pirate.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“What if I did?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“But you can’t be a pirate here.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I can be a Gypsy. And that’s lots more fun.
If I joined a pirate crew I couldn’t get to be
captain right away of course, so I would have to
mind somebody. Here I don’t have to mind anybody
at all.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Well, I never!” ejaculated Tess Kenway.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Well, I never!” repeated Dot, with similar
emphasis.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Say, what are you kids here for?” demanded
Sammy, with an attempt to turn the conversation
from his own evident failings.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh, we were brought here on a visit,” Tess
returned rather haughtily.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Huh! You <em>was</em>? Who you visiting? Is
Aggie with you? Or Neale?” and he looked
around suddenly as though choosing a way of
escape.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“We are here all alone,” said Dot reassuringly.
“You needn’t be afraid, Sammy.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223'></a>223</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Who’s afraid?” he said gruffly.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“You would be if Neale was with us, for Neale
would make you go home,” said the smallest
Kenway girl.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“But who brought you? What you here for?
Oh! That old bracelet I bet!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Yes,” sighed Dot. “They want it back.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Who want it back?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Those two ladies that sold us the basket,”
explained Tess.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Are they with this bunch of Gypsies?” asked
Sammy in surprise. “I haven’t seen them. And
I’ve been here two whole days.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“How did you come to be a Gypsy, Sammy?”
asked Dot with much curiosity.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Why, I—er—Well, I lost my clothes and my
money and didn’t have much to eat and that big
Gypsy saw me on the road and asked me if I
wanted to ride. So I came here with him and he
let me stay. And nobody does a thing to me. I
licked one boy,” added Sammy with satisfaction,
“so the others let me alone.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“But haven’t you seen either of those two
ladies that sold us the basket?” demanded Tess,
beginning to be worried a little.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Nope. I don’t believe they are here.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“But that man says they are here,” cried Tess.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224'></a>224</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Let’s go ask him. I—I won’t give that bracelet
to anybody else but one of those ladies.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Crickey!” exclaimed Sammy. “Don’t feel so
bad about it. Course there is a mistake somehow.
These folks are real nice folks. They wouldn’t
fool you.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
The three, Sammy looking very important, went
to find Big Jim. He was just as smiling as ever.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh, yes! The little ladies are not to be
worried. The women they want will soon come.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“You see?” said Sammy, boldly. “It will be
all right. Why, these people treat you <em>right</em>. I
tell you! You can do just as you please in a
Gypsy camp and nobody says anything to you.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“See!” exclaimed Tess suddenly. “Are they
packing up to leave? Or do they stay here all
the time?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
It was now late afternoon. Instead of the
supper fires being revived, they were smothered.
Men and women had begun loading the heavier
vans. The tents were coming down. Clotheslines
stretched between the trees were now being coiled
by the children. All manner of rubbish was being
thrown into the bushes.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I don’t know if they are moving. I’ll ask,”
said Sammy, somewhat in doubt.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
He went to a boy bigger than himself, but who
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225'></a>225</span>
seemed to be friendly. The little girls waited,
staring all about for the two women with whom
they had business.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I don’t care,” whispered Dot. “If they don’t
come pretty soon, and these Gypsies are going
away from here, we’ll just go back home, Tess.
We <em>can’t</em> give them the bracelet if we don’t see
them.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“But we do not want to walk home,” her sister
said slowly in return. “And we ought to make
Sammy go with us.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“You try to <em>make</em> Sammy do anything!” exclaimed
Dot, with scorn.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Their boy friend returned, swaggering as
usual. “Well, they are going to move,” he said.
“But I’m going with them. That boy—he was the
one I licked, but he’s a good kid—says they are
going to a pond where the fishing is great. Wish
I had my fishpole.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“But you must come back home with us,
Sammy,” began Tess gravely.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Not much I won’t! Don’t you think it,” cried
Sammy. “But you might get my fishing tackle
and jointed pole and sneak ’em out to me. There’s
good kids!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“We will do nothing sneaky for you at all,
Sammy Pinkney!” exclaimed Tess indignantly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226'></a>226</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Aw, go on! You can just as easy.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“We can, but we won’t. So there! And if you
don’t go home with us when the man takes us
back in his car we certainly will tell where you
are.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Be a telltale. <em>I</em> don’t care,” cried Sammy,
roughly. “And I won’t say just where we are
going from here, so you needn’t think my folks
will find me.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
One of the closed vans—something like a moving
van only with windows in the sides, a stove-pipe
sticking out of the roof, and a door at the
rear, with steps—seemed now to be ready to start.
A man climbed into the front seat to drive it.
Several women and smaller children got in at the
rear after the various bales and packages that had
been tossed in. The big man suddenly shouted
and beckoned to Tess and Dot.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Here, little ladies,” he said, still smiling his
wide smile. “You come go wit’ my mudder, eh?
Take you to find the Gypsy women you want to
see.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“But—er—Mr. Gypsy,” said Tess, somewhat
disturbed now, “we must go back home.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Sure. Tak’ you home soon as you see those
women and give them what you got for them.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
He strode across the camp to them. His smile
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227'></a>227</span>
was quite as wide, but did not seem to forecast
as much good-nature as at first.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Come now! Get in!” he commanded.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Hey!” cried Sammy. “What you doing?
Those little girls are friends of mine. You want
to let them ride in that open car—not in that box.
What d’you think we are?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Get out the way, boy!” commanded Big Jim.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
He seized Tess suddenly by the shoulders,
swung her up bodily despite her screams and
tossed her through the rear door of the Gypsy
van. Dot followed so quickly that she could
scarcely utter a frightened gasp.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Hey! Stop that! Those are the Kenway
girls. Why! Mr. Howbridge will come after them
and he’ll—he’ll—”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Sammy’s excited threat was stopped in his
throat. Big Jim’s huge hand caught the boy a
heavy blow upon the side of his head. The next
moment he was shot into the motor-van too and
the door was shut.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
He heard Tess and Dot sobbing somewhere
among the women and children already crowded
into the van. It was a stuffy place, for none of
the windows were open. Although this nomadic
people lived mostly out of doors, and never under
a real roof if they could help it, they did not seem
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228'></a>228</span>
to mind the smothering atmosphere of the van
which now, with a sudden lurch, started out of
the place of encampment.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Never you mind, Tess and Dot, they won’t
dare carry you far. Maybe they are taking you
home anyway,” said Sammy in a low voice. “The
first time they stop and let us out we’ll run away.
I will get you home all right.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“You—you can’t get yourself home, Sammy,”
sobbed Dot.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Maybe you like it being a Gypsy, but we
don’t,” added Tess.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I’ll fix it for you all right—”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
One of the old crones reached out in the semi-darkness
and slapped Sammy across the mouth.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Shut up!” she commanded harshly. But
when she tried to slap the boy again she screamed.
It must be confessed that Sammy bit her!
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“You lemme alone,” snarled the boy captive.
“And don’t you hit those girls. If you do I—I’ll
bite the whole lot of you!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
The women jabbered a good deal together in
their own tongue; but nobody tried to interfere
with Sammy thereafter. He shoved his way into
the van until he stood beside Tess and Dot.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Let’s not cry about it,” he whispered. “That
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229'></a>229</span>
won’t get us anywhere, that is sure. But the very
first chance we get—”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
No chance for escape however was likely to
arise while the Gypsy troop were en route. The
children could hear the rumble of the vans behind.
Soon Big Jim in his touring car passed this
first van and shouted to the driver. Then the
procession settled into a steady rate of speed and
the three little captives had not the least idea in
which direction they were headed nor where they
were bound.
</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Back at the old Corner House affairs were in a
terrible state of confusion. Linda had returned
from her voyage among the neighbors with absolutely
no news of the smaller girls. And Agnes
had discovered that the silver bracelet was
missing.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“It was Tess’s day for wearing it, but she did
not have it on when she went out to play,” the
older sister explained. “Do you suppose the
house has been robbed, Neale O’Neil?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Neale had been examining closely the piece of
paper that Agnes had found stuck to the plate
on which she had fed the beggar girl the day before
and also the note Mrs. McCall had received
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230'></a>230</span>
purporting to come from Mr. Howbridge’s butler.
Both were written in blue pencil, and by the same
hand without any doubt.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“It’s a plot clear enough. And naturally we
may believe that it was not hatched by that Miguel
Costello, the junkman. It looks as though it was
done by Big Jim’s crowd.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“But what have they done with the bairns?”
demanded the housekeeper, in horror.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh, Neale! have they stolen Tess and Dot, as
well as the silver bracelet?” was Agnes’ bitter
cry.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Got me. Don’t know,” muttered the boy.
“And what would they want the children for,
anyway?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Let us find out if any Gypsies have been seen
about the house this afternoon,” Agnes proposed.
“You see, Neale. Don’t send Linda.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Linda, indeed, was in a hopeless state. She
didn’t know, declared Mrs. McCall, whether she
was on her head or her heels!
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Neale ran out and searched the neighborhood
over. When he came back he had found nobody
who had set eyes on any Gypsies; but he had
heard from Mrs. Pease that Gypsies were camped
out of town. The store man had told her so.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh!” gasped Agnes, suddenly remembering.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231'></a>231</span>
“I heard about that. Mrs. Pinkney told me.
They are on the Buckshot Road, out beyond where
Carrie Poole lives. You know, Neale.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Sure I know where the Poole place is,” admitted
Neale. “We have all been there often
enough. And I can get the car—”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Do! Do!” begged Mrs. McCall. “You cannot
go too quickly, Neale O’Neil. And take the
police wi’ ye, laddie!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Take me with you, Neale!” commanded
Agnes. “We can find a constable out that way if
we need one. I know Mr. Ben Stryker who lives
just beyond the Pooles. And he is a constable,
for he stopped the car once when I was driving
and said he would have to arrest me if I did not
drive slower.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Sure!” said Neale. “Agnes knows all the
traffic cops on the route, I bet. But we don’t
<em>know</em> that the children have gone with the
Gypsies.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“And we never will know if you stand here and
argue. Anyway, it looks as though the silver
bracelet has been stolen by them.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Or by somebody,” granted the boy.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Ne’er mind the bit bracelet,” commanded the
housekeeper. “Find Tess and Dot. I am going
to put on my bonnet and shawl and go to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232'></a>232</span>
police station mysel’. Do you children hurry
away in the car as you promised.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
It was already supper time, but nobody thought
of that meal, unless it was Aunt Sarah. When
she came down to see what the matter was—why
the evening meal was so delayed—she found
Linda sobbing with her apron over her head in
the kitchen and the tea kettle boiled completely
dry.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
That was nothing, however, to the condition of
affairs at one o’clock that night when Ruth, with
Luke and Cecile Shepard, arrived at the old Corner
House. They had been delayed at the station
half an hour while Ruth telephoned for and obtained
a comfortable touring car for her visitors
and herself. Agnes did not have to beg her older
sister to put in a telephone. After this experience
Ruth was determined to do just that.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
The party arrived home to find the Corner
House lit up as though for a reception. But it
was not in honor of their arrival. The telegram
announcing Ruth’s coming had scarcely been noticed
by Mrs. McCall.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Mrs. McCall had recovered a measure of her
composure and good sense; but she could scarcely
welcome the guests properly. Aunt Sarah Maltby
had gone to bed, announcing that she was utterly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233'></a>233</span>
prostrated and should never get up again unless
Tess and Dot were found. Linda and Uncle Rufus
were equally distracted.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“But where are Agnes and Neale?” Ruth demanded,
very white and determined. “What are
they doing?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“They started out in the machine around eight
o’clock,” explained Mrs. McCall. “They are
searching high and low for the puir bairns.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“All alone?” gasped Ruth.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Mr. Pinkney has gone with them. And I believe
they were to pick up a constable. That
Neale O’Neil declares he will raid every Gypsy
camp and tramp’s roost in the county. And
Sammy’s father took a pistol with him.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“And you let Agnes go with them!” murmured
Ruth. “Suppose she gets shot?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“My maircy!” cried the housekeeper, clasping
her hands. “I never thought about that pistol
being dangerous, any more than Uncle Rufus’s
gun with the broken hammer.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234'></a>234</span><a name='chXXIV' id='chXXIV'></a>CHAPTER XXIV—THE CAPTIVES</h2>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
That ride, shut in the Gypsy van, was one that
neither Tess nor Dot nor Sammy Pinkney were
likely soon to forget. The car plunged along the
country road, and the distance the party traveled
was considerable, although the direction was circuitous
and did not, after two hours, take the
Gypsy clan much farther from Milton than they
had been at the previous camp.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
By eleven o’clock they pulled off the road into
a little glade that had been well known to the
leaders of the party. A new camp was established
in a very short time. Tents were again erected,
fires kindled for the late supper, and the life of the
Gypsy town was re-begun.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
But Sammy and the two little Corner House
girls were forbidden to leave the van in which
they had been made to ride.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Big Jim came over himself, banged Sammy with
his broad palm, and told him:
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“You keep-a them here—you see? If those kids
get out, I knock you good. See?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235'></a>235</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Sammy saw stars at least! He would not answer
the man. There was something beside stubbornness
to Sammy Pinkney. But stubbornness
stood him in good stead just now.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Don’t you mind, Tess and Dot,” he whispered,
his own voice broken with half-stifled sobs. “I’ll
get you out of it. We’ll run away first chance we
get.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“But it never does <em>you</em> any good to run away,
Sammy,” complained Tess. “You only get into
trouble. Dot and I don’t want to be beaten by
that man. He is horrid.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I wish we could see those nice ladies who sold
us the basket,” wailed Dot, quite desperate now.
“I—I’d be <em>glad</em> to give ’em back the bracelet.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Sh!” hissed Sammy. “We’ll run away and
we’ll take the bracelet along. These Gyps sha’n’t
ever get it again, so there!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Humph! I don’t see what you have to say
about <em>that</em>, Sammy,” scoffed Tess. “If the women
own it, of course they have got to have it. But
I don’t want that Big Jim to have it—not at all!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“He won’t get it. You leave it to me,” said
Sammy, with recovered assurance.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
The van door was neither locked nor barred.
But if the children had stepped out of it the firelight
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236'></a>236</span>
would have revealed their figures instantly
to the Gypsies.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Either the women bending over the pots and
pans at the fires or the children running about the
encampment would have raised a hue and cry if
the little captives had attempted to run away.
And there were a dozen burly men sitting about,
smoking and talking and awaiting the call to
supper.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
This meal was finally prepared. The fumes
from the pots reached the nostrils of Tess, Dot,
and Sammy, and they were all ravenously hungry.
Nor were they denied food. The Gypsies evidently
had no intention of maltreating the captives
in any particular as long as they obeyed and
did not try to escape.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
One young woman brought a great pan of stew
and bread and three spoons to the van and set it
on the upper step for the children.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“You eat,” said she, smiling, and the firelight
shining on her gold earrings. “It do you goot—yes?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh, Miss Gypsy!” begged Tess, “we want to
go home.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“That all right. Beeg Jeem tak-a you. To-morrow,
maybe.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
She went away hurriedly. But she had left them
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237'></a>237</span>
a plentiful supper. The three were too ravenous
to be delicate. They each seized a spoon and, as
Sammy advised, “dug in.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“This is the way all Gypsies eat,” he said,
proud of his knowledge. “Sometimes the men use
their pocket knives to cut up the meat. But they
don’t seem to have any forks. And I guess forks
aren’t necessary anyway.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“But they are nicer than fingers,” objected
Tess.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Huh? Are they?” observed the young barbarian.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
After they had completely cleared the pan of
every scrap and eaten every crumb of bread and
drunk the milk that had been brought to them in
a quart cup, Dot naturally gave way to sleepiness.
She began to whimper a little too.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“If that big, bad Gypsy man doesn’t take us
home pretty soon I shall have to sleep here, Sister,”
she complained.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“You lie right down on this bench,” said Tess
kindly, “and I will cover you up and you can sleep
as long as you want to.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
So Dot did this. But Sammy was not at all
sleepy. His mind was too active for that. He
was prowling about the more or less littered van.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Say!” he whispered to Tess, “there is a little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238'></a>238</span>
window here in the front overlooking the driver’s
seat. And it swings on a hinge like a door.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I don’t care, Sammy. I—I’m sleepy, too,”
confessed Tess, with a yawn behind her hand.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Say! don’t <em>you</em> go to sleep like a big kid,”
snapped the boy. “We’ve got to get away from
these Gyps.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I thought you were going to stay with them
forever.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Not to let that Big Jim bang me over the head.
Not much!” ejaculated Sammy fiercely. “If my
father saw him do that—”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“But your father isn’t here. If he was—”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“If he was you can just bet,” said Sammy with
confidence, “that Big Jim would not dare hit me.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I—I wish your father would come and take us
all home then,” went on Tess, with another yawn.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Well,” admitted Sammy, “I wish he would,
too. Crickey! but it’s awful to have girls along,
whether you are a pirate or a Gypsy.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“You needn’t talk!” snapped Tess, quite tart
for her. “We did not ask to come. And you
were here ‘fore we got here. And now you can’t
get away any more than Dot and I can.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Sh!” advised Sammy again, and earnestly.
“I got an idea.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239'></a>239</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“What is it?” asked Tess, without much curiosity.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“This here window in front!” whispered the
boy. “We can open it. It is all dark at that end
of the van. If we can slide out on to the seat we’ll
climb down in the dark and get into the woods.
I know the way to the road. I can see a patch of
it through the window. What say?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“But Dot? She sleeps so hard,” breathed Tess.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“We can poke her through the window on to the
seat. Then we will crawl through. If she doesn’t
wake up and holler—”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I’ll stop her from hollering,” agreed Tess
firmly. “We’ll try it, Sammy, before those awful
women get back into the van.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Fortunately for the attempt of the captives their
own supper had been dispatched with promptness.
The Gypsies were still sitting about over the meal
when Sammy opened that front window in the
van.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
He and Tess lifted Dot, who complained but
faintly and kept her eyes tightly closed, and
pushed her feet first through the small window.
The driver’s seat was broad and roomy. The little
girl lay there all right while first Tess and then
Sammy crept through the window.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240'></a>240</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
It was dark here, and they could scarcely see
the way to the ground. But Sammy ventured
down first, and after barking his shins a little
found the step and whispered his directions to
Tess about passing Dot down to him.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
They actually got to the ground themselves and
brought the smallest Corner House girl with them
without any serious mishap. Sammy tried to
carry Dot over his shoulder, but he could not stagger
far with her. And, too, the sleepy child began
to object.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Sh! Keep still!” hissed her sister in Dot’s
ear. “Do you want the Gypsies to get you
again?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
She had to help Sammy carry the child, however.
Dot was such a heavy sleeper—especially
when she first went to sleep—that nothing could
really bring her back to realities. The two stumbled
along with her in the deep shadows and actually
reached the woods that bordered the encampment.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Suddenly a dog barked. Somebody shouted to
the animal and it subsided with a sullen growl.
But in a moment another dog began to yap. The
guards of the camp realized that something was
going wrong, although as yet none of the dogs had
scented the escaping children exactly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241'></a>241</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh, hurry! Hurry!” gasped Tess. “The
dogs will chase us.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I am afraid they will,” admitted Sammy.
“We got to hide our trail.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“How’ll we do that, Sammy?” gasped Tess.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Like the Indians do,” declared the boy. “We
got to find a stream of water and wade in it.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“But I’ve got shoes and stockings on. And
Mrs. McCall says we can’t go wading without asking
permission.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Crickey! how you going to run away from
these Gypsies if you’ve got to mind what you’re
told all the time?” asked Sammy desperately.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“But won’t the water be cold? And why wade
in it, anyway?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“So the dogs can’t follow our scent. They can’t
follow scent through water. Come on. We got to
find a brook or something.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“There’s the canal,” ventured Tess, in an awed
whisper.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“The canal, your granny!” exclaimed the exasperated
boy. “That’s over your head, Tess Kenway.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Well! I don’t know of any other water. Oh!
Hear those dogs bark.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Don’t you s’pose I’ve got ears?” snapped
Sammy.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242'></a>242</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“They sound awful savage.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Yes. They’ve got some savage dogs,” admitted
the boy.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Will they bite us? Oh, Sammy! will they bite
us?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Not if they don’t catch us,” replied the boy,
staggering on, bearing the heavier end of Dot
while Tess carried her sister’s feet.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
They suddenly burst through a fringe of bushes
upon the open road. There was just starlight
enough to show them the way. The dogs were
still barking vociferously back at the Gypsy camp.
But there seemed to be no pursuit.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh, my gracious! I’ve torn my frock,” gasped
Tess. “Do wait, Sammy.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
The boy stopped. Indeed he had to, for his own
breath had given out. The three fell right down
on the grass beside the road, and Dot began to
whimper.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“You stop her, Tess!” exclaimed Sammy.
“You said you could. She will bring those Gypsies
right here.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Dot! Dot!” whispered Tess, shaking the
smaller girl. “Do you want to be a prisoner
again? Keep still!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“My—my knees are cold,” whined Dot.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243'></a>243</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Je-ru-sa-lem!” gasped Sammy explosively.
“<em>Now</em> she’s done it! We’re caught again.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
He jumped to his feet, but not quickly enough to
escape the outstretched hand of the figure that
had suddenly appeared beside them. A dark face
bent over the trio of frightened children.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“He’s a Gyp!” cried Sammy. “We’re done
for, Tess!”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244'></a>244</span><a name='chXXV' id='chXXV'></a>CHAPTER XXV—IT MUST BE ALL RIGHT</h2>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
As Mrs McCall told Ruth Kenway when she
arrived with Luke and Cecile at the old Corner
House, the other Kenway sister and Neale O’Neil
had not started out on their hunt for the Gypsy
encampment alone. Mr. Pinkney, hearing of the
absence of the smaller girls, had volunteered to
go with the searchers.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Somehow, my wife feels that Sammy may be
with Tess and Dot,” he explained to Neale and
Agnes. “I never contradict her at such times.
And perhaps he is. No knowing where that boy
of mine is likely to turn up, anyway.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“But you do not suppose for one instant, Mr.
Pinkney, that Sammy has come and coaxed my
sisters to run away?” cried Agnes from the tonneau,
as the car started out through Willow
Street.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I am not so sure about that. You know, he
got Dot to run away with him once,” chuckled Mr.
Pinkney.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245'></a>245</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“This is nothing like that, I am sure!” declared
Agnes.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I am with you there, Aggie,” admitted Neale.
“I guess this is a serious affair. The Gypsies are
in it.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Between the two, the boy and the girl told Mr.
Pinkney all about the silver bracelet and the
events connected with it. The man listened with
appreciation.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I don’t know, of course, anything about the
fight between the two factions of Gypsies over
what you call Queen Alma’s bracelet—”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“If it doesn’t prove to be Sarah Turner’s
bracelet,” interjected Agnes.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Yes. That is possible. They may have just
found it—those Gypsy women. And the story
Costello, the junkman, told us might be a fake,”
said Neale.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“However,” broke in Mr. Pinkney again,
“there is a chance that the bracelet was given to
Tess and Dot for a different purpose from any
you have suggested.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“What do you mean by that?” asked Neale and
Agnes in unison.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“It is a fact that some Gypsies do steal children.
Now, don’t be startled! It isn’t commonly done.
They are often accused without good reason. But
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246'></a>246</span>
Gypsies are always more or less mixed up with
traveling show people. There are many small tent
shows traveling about the country at this time of
year.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Like Twomley &amp; Sorber’s circus,” burst out
Agnes.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Smaller than that. Just one-ring affairs.
And the shows are regular ‘fly-by-nights.’ Gypsies
fraternize with them of course. And often
children are trained in those shows to be acrobats
who are doubtless picked up around the country—usually
children who have no guardians. And the
Gypsies sometimes pick up such.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh, but, Mr. Pinkney!” cried Agnes, “we are
so careful of Tess and Dot. Usually, I mean. I
don’t know what Ruth will say when she gets
home to-night. It looks as though we had been
very careless while she was gone.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I know what children have to go through in
a circus,” said Neale soberly. “But why should
the Gypsies have selected Tess and Dot?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Because, you tell me, they were playing circus,
and doing stunts at the very time the Gypsy
women sold them the basket.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh! So they were,” agreed Agnes. “Oh,
Neale!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Crickey! It might be, I suppose. I never
thought of that,” admitted the boy.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247'></a>247</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
He was carefully running the car while this
talk was going on. He soon drove past the Poole
place and later stopped at a little house where the
constable lived.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Mr. Ben Stryker was at home. It was not often
that automobile parties called at his door. Usually
they did not want to see Mr. Stryker, who was
a stickler for the “rules of the road.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“What’s the matter?” asked the constable, coming
out to the car. “Want to pay me your fine, so
as not to have to wait to see the Justice of the
Peace?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
He said it jokingly. When he heard about the
missing Kenway children and of the reason to fear
Gypsies had something to do with it, he jumped
into the car, taking Mr. Pinkney’s place in the
front seat beside Neale.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I’ve had my eye on Big Jim Costello ever since
he has been back here,” Stryker declared. “I sent
him away to jail once. He is a bad one. And if
he is mixed up in any kidnapping, I’ll put him into
the penitentiary for a long term.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“But of course we would not want to make them
trouble if the children went to the camp alone,”
ventured Agnes. “You know, they might have
been hunting for the two women who sold them
the basket.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Those Gypsies know what to do in such a case.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248'></a>248</span>
They know where I live, and they should have
brought the two little girls to me. I certainly have
it in for Big Jim.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
But as we have seen, when the party arrived
at the spot where the Gypsies had been encamped,
not a trace of them was left. That is, no trace
that pointed to the time or the direction of their
departure.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Maybe these Gypsies did not have a thing to
do with the absence of Tess and Dot,” whispered
Agnes.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“And maybe they had everything to do with it,”
declared Neale, aloud. “Looks to me as though
they had turned the trick and escaped.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“And in those motor-vans they can cover a deal
of ground,” suggested Mr. Pinkney.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Agnes broke down at this point and wept. The
constable had got out and with the aid of his
pocket lamp searched the vicinity. He saw plainly
where the vans had turned into the dusty road
and the direction they had taken.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“The best we can do is to follow them,” he advised.
“If I can catch them inside the county I’ll
be able to handle them. And if they go into the
next county I’ll get help. Well search their vans,
no matter where we catch them. All ready?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
The party went on. To catch the moving Gypsies was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249'></a>249</span>
no easy matter. Frequently Mr. Stryker
got down to look at the tracks. This was at every
cross road.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Fortunately the wheels of one of the Gypsy vans
had a peculiar tread. It was easy to see the marks
of these wheels in the dust. Therefore, although
the pursuit was slow, they managed to be sure they
were going right.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
From eleven o’clock until three in the morning
the motor-car was driven over the circuitous route
the nomad procession had taken earlier in the
night. Then they came to the new encampment.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Their approach was announced by the barking
of the mongrel dogs that guarded the camp. Half
the tribe seemed to be awake when the car slowed
down and stopped on the roadway. Mr. Stryker
got out and shouted for Big Jim.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Come out here!” said the constable threateningly.
“I know you are here, and I want to talk
with you, Jim Costello.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Well, whose chicken roost has been raided
now?” demanded Big Jim, approaching with his
smile and his impudence both in evidence.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“No chicken thievery,” snapped Stryker, flashing
his electric light into the big Gypsy’s face.
“Where are those kids?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“What kids? I got my own—and there’s a raft
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250'></a>250</span>
of them. I’ll give you a couple if you want.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Big Jim seemed perfectly calm and the other
Gypsies were like him. They routed out every
family in the camp. The constable and Neale
searched the tents and the vans. No trace of Tess
and Dot was to be found.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Everything you lay to the poor Gypsy,” said
Big Jim complainingly. “Now it is not chickens—it
is kids. Bah!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
He slouched away. Stryker called after him:
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Never mind, Jim. We’ll get you yet! You
watch your step.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
He came back to the Kenway car shaking his
head. “I guess they have not been here. I’ll come
back to-morrow when the Gypsies don’t expect me
and look again if your little sisters do not turn
up elsewhere. What shall we do now?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Agnes was weeping so that she could not speak.
Neale shook his head gloomily. Mr. Pinkney
sighed.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Well,” the latter said, “we might as well start
for home. No good staying here.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I’ll get you to Milton in much shorter time
than it took to get here,” said the constable.
“Keep right ahead, Mr. O’Neil. We’ll take the
first turn to the right and run on till we come to
Hampton Mills. It’s pretty near a straight road
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251'></a>251</span>
from there to Milton. And I can get a ride from
the Mills to my place with a fellow I know who
passes my house every morning.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Neale started the car and they left the buzzing
camp behind them. They had no idea that the
moment the sound of the car died away the Gypsies
leaped to action, packed their goods and chattels
again, and the tribe started swiftly for the
State line. Big Jim did not mean to be caught if
he could help it by Constable Stryker, who knew
his record.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
The Corner House car whirred over the rather
good roads to Hampton Mills and there the constable
parted from them. He promised to report
any news he might get of the absent children, and
they were to send him word if Tess and Dot were
found.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
The car rounded the pond where Sammy had
had his adventure at the ice-house and had ruined
his knickerbockers. It was a straight road from
that point to Milton. Going up the hill beside the
pond in the gray light of dawn, they saw ahead of
them a man laboring on in the middle of the road
with a child upon his shoulders, while two other
small figures walked beside him, clinging to his
coat.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“There’s somebody else moving,” said Mr.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252'></a>252</span>
Pinkney to Agnes. “What do you know about
little children being abroad at this time of the
morning?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Shall we give them a lift?” asked Neale.
“Only I don’t want to stop on this hill.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
But he did. He stopped in another minute because
Agnes uttered a piercing scream.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh, Tessie! Oh, Dot! It’s them! It’s the
children!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Great Moses!” ejaculated Mr. Pinkney, forced
likewise into excitement, “is that Sammy Pinkney?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
The man carrying Dot turned quickly. Tess and
Sammy both uttered eager yelps of recognition.
Dot bobbed sleepily above the head of the man
who carried her pickaback.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh, Agnes! isn’t this my day for wearing that
bracelet? Say, isn’t it?” she demanded.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
The dark man came forward, speaking very
politely and swiftly.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“It is the honest Kenway—yes? You remember
Costello? I am he. I find your sisters with
the bad Gypsies—yes. Then you will give me
Queen Alma’s bracelet—the great heirloom of our
family? I am friend—I bring children back for
you. You give me bracelet?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Tess and Dot were tumbled into their sister’s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253'></a>253</span>
arms. Mr. Pinkney jumped out of the car and
grabbed Sammy before he could run.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Costello, the junkman, repeated his request over
and over while Agnes was greeting the two little
girls as they deserved to be greeted. Finally he
made some impression upon her mind.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh, dear me!” Agnes cried in exasperation,
“how can I give it you? I don’t know where it is.
It’s been stolen.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Stolen? That Beeg Jeem!” Again Costello
exploded in his native tongue.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Tess nestled close to Agnes. She lifted her lips
and whispered in her sister’s ear:
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Don’t tell him. He’s a Gypsy, too, though I
guess he is a good one. I have got that bracelet
inside my dress. It’s safe.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
They did not tell Costello, the junkman, that at
this time. In fact, it was some months before Mr.
Howbridge, by direction of the Court, gave Queen
Alma’s bracelet into the hands of Miguel Costello,
who really proved in the end that he had the
better right to the bracelet that undoubtedly had
once belonged to the Queen of the Spanish
Gypsies.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
It had not been merely by chance that the young
Gypsy woman who had sold the green and yellow
basket to Tess and Dot had dropped that ornament
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254'></a>254</span>
into the basket. She had worn the bracelet, for
she was Big Jim’s daughter.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Without doubt it was the intention of the Gypsies
to engage the little girls’ interest through
this bracelet and get their confidence, to bring
about the very situation which they finally consummated.
One of the women confessed in court
that they could sell Tess and Dot for acrobats.
Or they thought they could.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
The appearance of Miguel Costello in Milton,
claiming the rightful ownership of the silver
bracelet, made the matter unexpectedly difficult for
Big Jim and his clan. Indeed, the Kenways had
much to thank Miguel Costello for.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
However, these mysteries were explained long
after this particular morning on which the children
were recovered. No such home-coming had
ever been imagined, and the old Corner House and
vicinity staged a celebration that will long be
remembered.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Luke Shepard had been put to bed soon after his
arrival. But he would not be content until he got
up again and came downstairs in his bathrobe to
greet the returned wanderers.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Agnes just threw herself into Ruth’s arms when
she first saw her elder sister, crying:
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh! don’t you <em>dare</em> ever go away again, Ruth
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255'></a>255</span>
Kenway, without taking the rest of us with you.
We’re not fit to be left alone.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I am afraid some day, Agnes, you will have to
get along without me,” said Ruth placidly, but
smiling into Luke’s eyes as she said it. “You
know, we are growing up.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Aggie isn’t ever going to grow up,” grumbled
Neale. “She is just a kid.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh, is <em>that</em> so, Mr. Smartie?” cried Agnes, suddenly
drying her eyes. “I’d have you know I am
just as much grown up as you are.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh, dear, me, I’m so sleepy,” moaned Dot.
“I—I didn’t sleep very well at all last night.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Goodness! I should think Sammy and I ought
to be the ones to be sleepy. We didn’t have any
chance at all!” Tess exclaimed.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
As for Sammy, he was taken home by an apparently
very stern father to meet a wildly grateful
mother. Mrs. Pinkney drew the sting from all
verbal punishment Mr. Pinkney might have given
his son.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“And the dear boy! I knew he had not forgotten
us when I found he had taken that picture
with him. Did you, Sammy?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Did I what, Mom?” asked Sammy, his mouth
comfortably filled with cake.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“That picture. You know, the one we all had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256'></a>256</span>
taken down at Pleasant Cove that time. The one
of your father and you and me that you kept on
your bureau. When I saw that you had taken that
with you to remember us by——”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh, crickey, Mom! Buster, the bull pup, ate
that old picture up a month ago,” said the nonsentimental
Sammy.

(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the

Gutenberg-tm License.

     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
